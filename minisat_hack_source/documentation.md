#### **Overview**
This file is a patched version of the MiniSat SAT solver, modified to support features such as:
- Compatibility with SAT Competition 2013 output requirements.
- Optional generation of DRUP proofs (Deletions in Reverse Unit Propagation).
- Enhancements in conflict analysis, clause learning, and decision heuristics with additional parameters like LBD (Literal Block Distance).

It retains the core functionalities of MiniSat while integrating new features and optimizations specific to the patched version.

### **Key Sections and Functionalities**

---

#### **1. New and Patched Features**

- **SAT Competition 2013 Output**: Output conforms to competition standards, ensuring compatibility for benchmarking.
- **DRUP Proof Generation**: Adds support for generating proofs in DRUP format, which is essential for proof logging in SAT solving competitions.
- **Literal Block Distance (LBD)**:
  - Introduced for conflict clause learning.
  - LBD measures the number of decision levels in a clause.
  - Clauses with smaller LBD are considered high-quality and prioritized during learning and retention.

---

#### **2. Options**

New configuration options for the patched version include:
- **LBD Cutoffs**:
  - `opt_lbd_cut`: Threshold for deciding whether a learned clause is retained as core.
  - `opt_lbd_cut_max`: Maximum threshold for LBD values.
- **Conflict Processing**:
  - `opt_cp_increase`: Interval for reducing the learned clause database.
  - `opt_core_tolerance`: Controls tolerance for retaining core clauses.
- **Heuristic Parameters**:
  - `opt_K` and `opt_R`: Modify restart and decision heuristics.
- **Compatibility Options**:
  - `opt_var_decay`, `opt_clause_decay`, and `opt_phase_saving` provide additional control over variable and clause decay rates.

---

#### **3. Constructor and Destructor**

- **`Solver()`**:
  - Initializes core and patched parameters such as LBD cutoffs and heuristic constants.
  - Sets up clause storage, decision heuristics, and restart logic.
- **`~Solver()`**:
  - Cleans up allocated resources and ensures graceful termination.

---

#### **4. Conflict Analysis and Learning**

- **LBD Evaluation**:
  - LBD is used to classify learned clauses into core or non-core.
  - Core clauses are retained longer, while non-core clauses may be deleted during database reduction.
- **`analyze()`**:
  - Produces a conflict clause and determines the backtracking level.
  - Integrates LBD computation to prioritize learned clauses with low LBD values.

---

#### **5. Clause Management**

- **`addClause_()`**:
  - Adds clauses while eliminating false or duplicate literals.
  - Checks for DRUP proof generation if enabled.
- **`attachClause()` / `detachClause()`**:
  - Updates the watch lists for efficient unit propagation.
- **`reduceDB()`**:
  - Retains only high-quality learned clauses based on LBD and activity scores.

---

#### **6. Propagation**

- **`propagate()`**:
  - Implements unit propagation, updating variable assignments and checking for conflicts.
  - Returns the first conflicting clause if one arises.

---

#### **7. Search and Decision Making**

- **`search()`**:
  - Implements the main CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) loop with enhancements.
  - Integrates restart policies:
    - Luby sequence for periodic restarts.
    - Dynamic restarts based on heuristic thresholds (`opt_K`, `opt_R`).
  - Uses LBD values to guide learning and pruning.

- **`pickBranchLit()`**:
  - Selects the next decision variable using activity-based heuristics or randomization.

---

#### **8. DRUP Support**

- **DRUP Proofs**:
  - Modifications ensure all clause additions and deletions are logged in the DRUP format.
  - This is essential for verifying the correctness of the SAT solver's results.

---

#### **9. Output and Debugging**

- **`toDimacs()`**:
  - Exports the SAT problem in DIMACS format.
  - Includes learned clauses and assumptions.
- **Statistics**:
  - Provides verbose statistics during solving, including conflicts, restarts, LBD values, and memory usage.

---

#### **10. Garbage Collection**

- **`garbageCollect()`**:
  - Optimizes memory by relocating active clauses and freeing unused memory.
  - Ensures efficient handling of clause storage as the solver progresses.
