### Explanation of Changes and Impact on Runtime Performance:

1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`.
   - **Impact**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more adaptive and can lead to better performance on a wide range of problems by balancing exploration and exploitation.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from `512` to `256`.
   - **Impact**: A lower Luby factor can reduce the number of restarts, potentially leading to more focused search and improved performance on certain problem instances.

3. **PHASE**: Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `PhaseCachingAutoEraseStrategy`.
   - **Impact**: Phase caching can reduce the overhead of phase selection and improve performance by reusing previously learned phases, especially in problems with repetitive patterns.

4. **CLADECAY**: Slightly reduced from `0.999` to `0.998`.
   - **Impact**: A slightly faster decay rate for clause activities can help in more dynamic environments where older clauses become less relevant, leading to more efficient memory usage and faster convergence.

5. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from `100` to `50`.
   - **Impact**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can speed up the early stages of the search by increasing the frequency of restarts, which can help in quickly exploring different parts of the solution space.

6. **VARDECAY**: Increased from `0.95` to `0.96`.
   - **Impact**: A slightly slower decay for variable activities can maintain a more stable and diverse set of variables in the search, potentially improving the quality of solutions.

7. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.8`.
   - **Impact**: A smaller increment factor can lead to a more gradual increase in the conflict bound, allowing for a more controlled exploration of the search space and potentially avoiding premature convergence.

8. **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`.
   - **Impact**: Simplifying the simplification level can reduce the overhead of simplification operations, leading to faster overall performance, especially on large or complex problems.

9. **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD`.
   - **Impact**: Using the LBD (Literal Block Distance) strategy instead of LBD2 can be more efficient in terms of clause cleaning, as it may require fewer resources while still maintaining good performance in removing irrelevant clauses.

These adjustments aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and improve the efficiency of the solver's search process, ultimately leading to better runtime performance.
