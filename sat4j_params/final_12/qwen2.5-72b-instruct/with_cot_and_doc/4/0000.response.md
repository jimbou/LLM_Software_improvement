### Explanation of Changes:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`. The Luby restart strategy is generally more adaptive and can lead to better performance by dynamically adjusting the restart intervals.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from `512` to `256`. Lowering the Luby factor can help the solver find solutions faster by reducing the number of conflicts before a restart, which can be beneficial for certain problem types.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from `100` to `50`. For the FixedPeriod strategy, a shorter period can sometimes lead to quicker convergence, especially in problems where frequent restarts can help escape local optima.

4. **PHASE**: Kept as `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`. This strategy is often effective and does not require change unless specific performance issues are observed.

5. **CLADECAY**: Slightly reduced from `0.999` to `0.998`. A slightly lower decay factor can help maintain a more stable set of clauses, potentially improving performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from `100` to `50`. A lower initial conflict bound can help the solver start making progress more quickly, which can be beneficial for problems with many initial conflicts.

7. **VARDECAY**: Increased from `0.95` to `0.96`. A slightly higher decay factor for variable activities can help maintain a more balanced exploration of variables, which can improve overall performance.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.8`. A lower increment factor can help the solver adjust more finely to the problem's structure, potentially leading to better performance.

9. **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`. Expensive simplification can be time-consuming and may not always provide a significant benefit. Simple simplification is often sufficient and can reduce overhead.

10. **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD`. The LBD strategy is generally more efficient and can help maintain a cleaner set of clauses, which can improve performance.
