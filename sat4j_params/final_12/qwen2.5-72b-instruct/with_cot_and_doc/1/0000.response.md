### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**:
   - Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`.
   - **Impact**: Luby restarts often provide better performance on a wide range of problems by dynamically adjusting the restart intervals, leading to more efficient exploration of the search space.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from 512 to 256.
   - **Impact**: A lower Luby factor can help reduce the time between restarts, potentially leading to faster convergence on some instances.

3. **PHASE**:
   - Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy`.
   - **Impact**: This strategy uses information from recently learned clauses, which can improve decision-making and reduce conflicts.

4. **CLADECAY**:
   - Reduced from 0.999 to 0.998.
   - **Impact**: A slightly faster decay rate can help in discarding less useful clauses more quickly, potentially improving performance.

5. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - Reduced from 100 to 50.
   - **Impact**: A lower initial conflict bound can help in quicker restarts, which can be beneficial for problems that benefit from more frequent restarts.

6. **VARDECAY**:
   - Increased from 0.95 to 0.96.
   - **Impact**: A slightly slower decay rate can help in maintaining the importance of variables longer, which can be useful for certain problem types.

7. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from 2.0 to 1.8.
   - **Impact**: A smaller increase factor can lead to more controlled and gradual increases in the conflict bound, potentially improving stability and performance.

8. **SIMP**:
   - Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`.
   - **Impact**: Simplifying the problem less aggressively can reduce the overhead of simplification steps, potentially leading to faster overall runtime.

9. **CLEANING**:
   - Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD`.
   - **Impact**: Using a simpler LBD strategy can reduce the computational cost of clause cleaning while still maintaining effective clause management.

These changes aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, reducing overhead, and improving the efficiency of the solver.
