### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**:
   - Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`.
   - **Impact**: Luby restarts often provide better performance by balancing exploration and exploitation, leading to faster convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from `512` to `256`.
   - **Impact**: A lower Luby factor can help in achieving more frequent restarts, which can prevent the solver from getting stuck in local minima, thus potentially improving performance.

3. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - Reduced from `100` to `50`.
   - **Impact**: A lower initial conflict bound can lead to more frequent restarts early on, helping the solver to explore different parts of the search space more quickly.

4. **CLADECAY**:
   - Reduced from `0.999` to `0.995`.
   - **Impact**: A slightly lower decay factor for clause activities can help in maintaining a more dynamic set of clauses, which can improve the solver's ability to adapt to changes in the problem structure.

5. **VARDECAY**:
   - Reduced from `0.95` to `0.9`.
   - **Impact**: A lower decay factor for variable activities can help in more rapidly adapting to the changing importance of variables, potentially leading to faster convergence.

6. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from `2.0` to `1.8`.
   - **Impact**: A slightly lower increase factor can help in more fine-grained control over the conflict bound, preventing overly aggressive increases that might slow down the solver.

7. **SIMP**:
   - Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`.
   - **Impact**: Simple simplification is less computationally intensive, which can reduce the overall runtime without significantly affecting the quality of the solution.

8. **CLEANING**:
   - Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD`.
   - **Impact**: Using the LBD strategy instead of LBD2 can lead to more efficient clause cleaning, potentially reducing the memory footprint and improving runtime performance.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, while also reducing computational overhead, thereby improving the overall runtime performance of the solver.
