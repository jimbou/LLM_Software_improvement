### Explanation of Changes:
1. **RESTARTS**:
   - Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`.
   - **Impact**: The Luby restart strategy is known for its adaptability and can help in escaping local minima more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on a wide range of problems.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from 512 to 256.
   - **Impact**: A lower Luby factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in exploring different parts of the search space and potentially finding solutions faster.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**:
   - Reduced from 100 to 50.
   - **Impact**: A shorter fixed period can increase the frequency of restarts, which might be beneficial for certain problem instances where quick exploration is needed.

4. **CLADECAY**:
   - Reduced from 0.999 to 0.995.
   - **Impact**: A slightly faster decay rate for clause activities can help in reducing the influence of older clauses, potentially improving the solver's ability to focus on more relevant information.

5. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - Reduced from 100 to 50.
   - **Impact**: A lower initial conflict bound can lead to more frequent restarts initially, which can help in quickly identifying promising search directions.

6. **VARDECAY**:
   - Reduced from 0.95 to 0.97.
   - **Impact**: A slightly slower decay rate for variable activities can help in maintaining the influence of recently active variables, potentially leading to more stable and effective variable selection.

7. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - Reduced from 2.0 to 1.8.
   - **Impact**: A smaller increase factor for the conflict bound can lead to a more gradual increase in the number of conflicts before a restart, which might help in balancing exploration and exploitation.

8. **SIMP**:
   - Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`.
   - **Impact**: Simplification can be computationally expensive. Using a simpler strategy can reduce overhead and potentially speed up the overall solving process.

9. **CLEANING**:
   - Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD`.
   - **Impact**: The LBD strategy is generally more efficient and can help in removing less useful clauses more effectively, potentially leading to a more streamlined and faster-solving process.
