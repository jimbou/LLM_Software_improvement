### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`. Luby restarts provide a more balanced and adaptive approach to restarting, which can help in escaping local minima and finding solutions faster.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 256. A lower Luby factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in diversifying the search space and potentially reducing runtime.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter fixed period for phase selection can help in adapting more quickly to the problem structure, leading to better performance.

4. **PHASE**: Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `RNDPhaseSelectionStrategy`. Random phase selection can introduce more variability, which can be beneficial in complex problems by preventing premature convergence.

5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.995. A slightly faster decay rate for clause activity can help in maintaining a more dynamic and responsive search process, potentially improving convergence speed.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in reducing the initial overhead and speeding up the early stages of the solving process.

7. **VARDECAY**: Reduced from 0.95 to 0.99. A slower variable decay rate can help in maintaining the relevance of variables over time, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on important parts of the problem.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A smaller increment factor can help in fine-tuning the conflict bound more precisely, leading to more efficient conflict resolution.

9. **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `BASIC_SIMPLIFICATION`. Basic simplification is less resource-intensive and can reduce the overall computational load, potentially improving runtime performance.

10. **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD1`. Using a lower LBD threshold for cleaning can help in maintaining a cleaner and more manageable set of learned clauses, which can improve the solver's efficiency.

These adjustments aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce unnecessary computational overhead, and fine-tune the solver's behavior to achieve better runtime performance.
