### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from 'Glucose21Restarts' to 'LubyRestarts'. Luby restarts are generally more adaptive and can help escape local minima more effectively, leading to better performance on a wider range of problems.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 256. A lower Luby factor means more frequent restarts, which can help in exploring different parts of the search space and potentially finding solutions faster.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter fixed period for restarts can help in quickly adapting to changes in the search landscape, reducing the time spent in unproductive areas.

4. **PHASE**: Changed from 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy' to 'RSTPPhaseSelectionStrategy'. RSTP (Randomized SAT-based Phase Selection) is often more effective in making decisions that lead to faster convergence.

5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.998. A slightly more aggressive clause decay can help in maintaining a more relevant set of clauses, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in quickly identifying conflicts and making progress earlier in the solving process.

7. **VARDECAY**: Increased from 0.95 to 0.96. A slightly less aggressive variable decay can help in retaining more information about the importance of variables, which can lead to better decision-making.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A smaller increment factor for the conflict bound can help in more finely controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to more stable and efficient solving.

9. **SIMP**: Changed from 'EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION' to 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'. Cheaper simplification can reduce overhead while still providing useful reductions in the problem size, leading to overall performance gains.

10. **CLEANING**: Changed from 'LBD2' to 'LBD1'. Using a lower LBD threshold can help in more aggressively cleaning up less useful clauses, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

These changes collectively aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and improve the solver's ability to converge to solutions efficiently.
