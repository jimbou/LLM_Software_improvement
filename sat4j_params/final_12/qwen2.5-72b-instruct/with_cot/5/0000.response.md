### Explanation of Changes:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts`. Luby restarts often provide better performance by balancing between exploration and exploitation, leading to faster convergence.
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 256. A lower factor can reduce the time between restarts, which can help escape local minima more frequently.
3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter period can help the solver adapt more quickly to changes in the problem landscape.
4. **PHASE**: Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy`. Random phase selection can sometimes break symmetry and avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.
5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.995. A slightly higher decay rate can help reduce the size of clauses more effectively, potentially improving performance.
6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. Starting with a lower conflict bound can help the solver find conflicts more quickly and adjust its strategy sooner.
7. **VARDECAY**: Reduced from 0.95 to 0.9. A faster variable decay rate can help the solver focus on more relevant variables, reducing the search space.
8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A smaller increment factor can help the solver adjust the conflict bound more gradually, avoiding overshooting.
9. **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`. Less expensive simplification can speed up the solving process without significantly impacting solution quality.
10. **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD1`. Lowering the LBD threshold can help remove less useful learned clauses more aggressively, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

These changes are aimed at reducing the overall runtime by making the solver more adaptive and efficient in its search strategy.
