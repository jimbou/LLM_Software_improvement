### Explanation of Changes and Impact on Runtime Performance:

1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from 'Glucose21Restarts' to 'LubyRestarts'. Luby restarts use a more adaptive strategy, which can help escape local minima and improve convergence speed, potentially reducing the overall runtime.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 256. A lower Luby factor means that the restarts will be triggered more frequently, which can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more effectively and potentially converge faster.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter fixed period for clause deletion can help keep the clause database smaller and more manageable, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

4. **PHASE**: Changed from 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy' to 'RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy'. Random phase selection can help break symmetry and explore the search space more thoroughly, potentially leading to faster solving times in some cases.

5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.995. A slightly faster decay rate for clause weights can help reduce the number of irrelevant clauses, making the solver more efficient.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. Starting with a lower conflict bound can help the solver quickly find and resolve conflicts, leading to faster initial progress.

7. **VARDECAY**: Reduced from 0.95 to 0.9. A faster decay rate for variable activities can help the solver focus on more relevant variables, improving efficiency.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A smaller increase factor for the conflict bound can help maintain a more balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, potentially leading to better performance.

9. **SIMP**: Changed from 'EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION' to 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'. Expensive simplification can be time-consuming. Using cheaper simplification techniques can reduce overhead and improve overall performance.

10. **CLEANING**: Changed from 'LBD2' to 'LBD3'. Using a higher LBD (Literal Block Distance) threshold can help remove more redundant clauses, keeping the clause database cleaner and improving solver efficiency.

These changes aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce memory overhead, and improve the solver's ability to find solutions quickly and efficiently.
