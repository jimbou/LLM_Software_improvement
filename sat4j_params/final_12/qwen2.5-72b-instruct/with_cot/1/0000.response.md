### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from 'Glucose21Restarts' to 'LubyRestarts'. Luby restarts can help escape local minima more effectively, leading to better overall performance for many SAT problems.
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 256. A lower factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in finding solutions faster by diversifying the search space.
3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter fixed period for phase saving can help in adapting to changes in the problem structure more quickly.
4. **PHASE**: Changed from 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy' to 'RandsatPhaseSelectionStrategy'. Randomized phase selection can sometimes lead to faster convergence on certain types of problems.
5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.998. A slightly lower decay rate can help in reducing the size of clauses more effectively, potentially improving performance.
6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. Starting with a lower conflict bound can help in finding conflicts and learning more quickly, leading to faster convergence.
7. **VARDECAY**: Reduced from 0.95 to 0.9. A lower variable decay rate can help in focusing the search on more relevant variables, improving efficiency.
8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A smaller increment factor can help in more controlled growth of the conflict bound, potentially leading to more stable and efficient search.
9. **SIMP**: Changed from 'EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION' to 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'. Cheaper simplification can reduce overhead and improve runtime performance, especially for large problems.
10. **CLEANING**: Changed from 'LBD2' to 'LBD3'. Using a higher LBD threshold can help in removing less useful learned clauses, potentially improving performance by keeping the clause database cleaner and more focused.
