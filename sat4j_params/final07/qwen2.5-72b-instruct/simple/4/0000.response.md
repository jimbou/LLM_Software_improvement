Optimizing SAT solver parameters can significantly improve runtime efficiency. Based on the provided parameters and common practices in SAT solving, here are some adjustments that might help:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **RESTARTS**: 'LubyRestarts' (Luby sequence is generally more effective and adaptive)
- **LUBYFACTOR**: 64 (Reducing this can help with more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial for many instances)
- **FIXEDPERIOD**: 50 (Lowering this can help with more dynamic clause management)
- **PHASE**: 'RNGPhaseSelectionStrategy' (Random phase selection can sometimes break symmetry and lead to faster convergence)
- **CLADECAY**: 0.99 (Slightly reducing this can help with more aggressive clause decay, which can reduce memory usage and improve speed)
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: 50 (Lower initial conflict bound to start with a more aggressive search)
- **VARDECAY**: 0.9 (More aggressive variable decay can help focus on more relevant variables)
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: 1.5 (Reducing this can help with more controlled growth of the conflict bound)
- **SIMP**: 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION' (Cheaper simplification can reduce overhead and improve runtime)
- **CLEANING**: 'LBD3' (Increasing LBD threshold can help with more selective cleaning, which can improve performance)

### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Switching to 'LubyRestarts' provides a more adaptive restart strategy, which is often more effective than fixed or other restart strategies.
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reducing this value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima more effectively.
3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Lowering this value can make the solver more responsive to changes in the search space.
4. **PHASE**: Using 'RNGPhaseSelectionStrategy' can help break symmetry and potentially find solutions faster.
5. **CLADECAY**: Slightly reducing this value can help manage the clause database more efficiently.
6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Starting with a lower initial conflict bound can help the solver converge faster initially.
7. **VARDECAY**: More aggressive variable decay can help focus on more relevant variables, potentially leading to faster solving.
8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: A slightly lower factor can help control the growth of the conflict bound, preventing it from becoming too large too quickly.
9. **SIMP**: 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION' reduces the overhead associated with simplification, which can improve overall runtime.
10. **CLEANING**: Increasing the LBD threshold to 'LBD3' can help with more selective cleaning, which can improve performance by removing less useful clauses.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime efficiency of your SAT solver. However, the optimal settings can vary depending on the specific problem instance, so it's always a good idea to experiment with different configurations to find the best settings for your particular use case.
