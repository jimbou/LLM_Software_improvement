Optimizing SAT solver parameters for runtime efficiency can be quite nuanced and often requires empirical testing to find the best combination. However, based on common practices and theoretical insights, here are some suggestions to potentially improve the runtime performance of your SAT solver:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts` (instead of `Glucose21Restarts`)
  - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is known for its robustness and adaptability, which can help in escaping local minima more effectively.
  
- **LUBYFACTOR**: 128 (reduced from 512)
  - **Reason**: A smaller Luby factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in finding solutions faster for many instances.

- **FIXEDPERIOD**: 50 (reduced from 100)
  - **Reason**: A shorter fixed period can help the solver react more quickly to changes in the search space, potentially leading to faster convergence.

- **PHASE**: `RNDPhaseSelectionStrategy` (instead of `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`)
  - **Reason**: Random phase selection can sometimes break symmetry and help the solver explore different parts of the search space more efficiently.

- **CLADECAY**: 0.995 (slightly reduced from 0.999)
  - **Reason**: A slightly faster decay rate can help in reducing the weight of older clauses, which can improve the solver's focus on more recent and relevant information.

- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: 50 (reduced from 100)
  - **Reason**: Starting with a lower initial conflict bound can help the solver make progress more quickly in the early stages of the search.

- **VARDECAY**: 0.9 (reduced from 0.95)
  - **Reason**: A faster variable decay rate can help the solver forget less useful variables more quickly, which can improve the overall search efficiency.

- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: 1.5 (reduced from 2.0)
  - **Reason**: A smaller increment factor can help in more finely controlling the growth of the conflict bound, which can prevent the solver from becoming too aggressive too quickly.

- **SIMP**: `CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION` (instead of `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`)
  - **Reason**: Cheaper simplification strategies can reduce the overhead of preprocessing, which can lead to faster overall runtime, especially for large instances.

- **CLEANING**: `LBD3` (increased from `LBD2`)
  - **Reason**: A higher LBD threshold can help in removing less useful learned clauses more aggressively, which can reduce memory usage and improve the solver's performance.

### Summary:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 128
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'RNDPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.9
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.5
SIMP := 'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD3'
```

### Note:
These optimizations are based on general principles and may need to be fine-tuned further based on the specific characteristics of the SAT instances you are solving. It is always a good idea to perform empirical testing with a variety of instances to validate these settings.
