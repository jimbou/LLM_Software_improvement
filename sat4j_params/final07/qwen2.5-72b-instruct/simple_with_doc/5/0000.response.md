To optimize the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their impact on performance and the specific problem being solved. Here are some recommendations:

1. **RESTARTS**: The choice of restart strategy can significantly affect performance. `Glucose21Restarts` is a good default, but `LubyRestarts` often provides better performance for many problems due to its adaptive nature. We will try `LubyRestarts`.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: This factor is crucial for the Luby restart strategy. A higher value can lead to more frequent restarts, which might help escape local minima but can also increase overhead. A value of 256 is a good balance.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Since we are using `LubyRestarts`, this parameter is less relevant. However, if you decide to use `FixedPeriodRestarts`, a value of 100 is reasonable.

4. **PHASE**: The phase selection strategy can influence the solver's ability to find solutions quickly. `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` is generally effective, but `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy` can sometimes provide better performance by leveraging recent learned clauses.

5. **CLADECAY**: A slightly higher decay factor can help in reducing the number of clauses that are kept active, potentially improving performance. A value of 0.995 is a good compromise.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: The initial conflict bound should be set to a value that balances between early restarts and allowing enough conflicts to gather useful information. A value of 50 is a good starting point.

7. **VARDECAY**: A decay factor of 0.95 is typically effective, but a slightly lower value can sometimes help in focusing on more relevant variables. A value of 0.93 can be tried.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: A higher increment factor can lead to more aggressive restarts, which can be beneficial for certain problems. A value of 2.5 is a good balance.

9. **SIMP**: Simplification can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance. `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` is often sufficient and faster than `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`.

10. **CLEANING**: Clause cleaning helps in managing memory and keeping the solver efficient. `LBD2` is a good choice, but `LBD` can be slightly more aggressive and might improve performance in some cases.

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 100
PHASE := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.93
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 2.5
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the solver. Always test these configurations with your specific problem to ensure they provide the desired performance improvements.
