To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make several adjustments based on the provided documentation and common best practices in SAT solving. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective than the default `Glucose21Restarts` for a wide range of problems. It dynamically adjusts the restart intervals, which can help escape local minima more effectively.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: `256`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the Luby factor from 512 to 256 can help balance the frequency of restarts, potentially leading to faster convergence without overly frequent restarts that might disrupt the search process.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: `100` (unchanged)
   - **Reason**: Since we are switching to `LubyRestarts`, the `FIXEDPERIOD` parameter is not directly relevant. However, if you decide to use `FixedPeriodRestarts`, this value seems reasonable for many problems.

4. **PHASE**: `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Reason**: This phase selection strategy often provides better performance by leveraging the most recent learned clauses, which can guide the solver more effectively.

5. **CLADECAY**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause decay factor can help retain more information about the clauses, which can be beneficial for complex problems.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help the solver start with a more aggressive approach, potentially finding conflicts and making progress faster.

7. **VARDECAY**: `0.97`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the variable decay factor slightly can help maintain a more balanced activity distribution, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on important variables.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: `1.8`
   - **Reason**: A slightly lower increase factor can help the solver adapt more gradually to the problem, potentially avoiding overly aggressive increases in the conflict bound.

9. **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: While `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` can be very thorough, it is computationally expensive. Using `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` can reduce overhead while still providing useful simplifications.

10. **CLEANING**: `LBD`
    - **Reason**: The `LBD` strategy is generally more efficient and effective than `LBD2` for clause cleaning, as it balances the need to keep useful clauses while removing less relevant ones.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 100
PHASE := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.97
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of the SAT solver while maintaining its effectiveness in solving the given problems.
