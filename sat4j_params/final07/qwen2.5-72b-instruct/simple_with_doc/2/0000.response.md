To optimize the runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can adjust the parameters based on their descriptions and typical performance impacts. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS** := `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more adaptive and can lead to better performance compared to fixed strategies like `Glucose21Restarts`. It dynamically adjusts the restart intervals, which can help in finding solutions faster.

2. **LUBYFACTOR** := `256`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the Luby factor from 512 to 256 can make the restart intervals more frequent, potentially leading to faster convergence. However, it should not be too low to avoid excessive restarts.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD** := `200`
   - **Reason**: If using `FixedPeriodRestarts`, increasing the period slightly from 100 to 200 can give the solver more time to explore the search space before restarting, which might improve performance.

4. **PHASE** := `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Reason**: This phase selection strategy uses information from recently learned clauses, which can help in making more informed decisions and reduce the number of conflicts.

5. **CLADECAY** := `0.995`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause decay factor from 0.999 to 0.995 can help in more aggressively forgetting less useful clauses, which can improve performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND** := `150`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the initial conflict bound from 100 to 150 gives the solver more leeway before triggering a restart, which can help in exploring deeper parts of the search space.

7. **VARDECAY** := `0.97`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the variable decay factor from 0.95 to 0.97 can help in more quickly forgetting less useful variables, which can improve performance.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR** := `1.8`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the conflict bound increase factor from 2.0 to 1.8 can help in more gradual adjustments, which can prevent over-aggressive restarts and improve performance.

9. **SIMP** := `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: Using a simpler simplification strategy can reduce the overhead of the simplification process, which can lead to faster overall performance without significantly compromising the quality of the solution.

10. **CLEANING** := `LBD`
    - **Reason**: The LBD (Literal Block Distance) cleaning strategy is generally more effective than LBD2 and can help in maintaining a cleaner set of clauses, leading to better performance.

### Summary of Changes:
- Switched from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts` for more adaptive restarts.
- Adjusted `LUBYFACTOR` to 256 for more frequent but controlled restarts.
- Increased `FIXEDPERIOD` to 200 for more exploration.
- Changed `PHASE` to `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy` for better decision-making.
- Reduced `CLADECAY` to 0.995 for more aggressive clause forgetting.
- Increased `INITCONFLICTBOUND` to 150 for more exploration before restarts.
- Reduced `VARDECAY` to 0.97 for more aggressive variable forgetting.
- Reduced `CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR` to 1.8 for more gradual adjustments.
- Switched from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` to reduce overhead.
- Changed `CLEANING` to `LBD` for more effective clause cleaning.

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the solver.
