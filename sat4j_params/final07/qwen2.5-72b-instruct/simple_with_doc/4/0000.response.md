To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully select parameters that balance between speed and effectiveness. Here are the optimized settings based on the provided documentation and common best practices:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective than Glucose21Restarts for a wide range of problems. It dynamically adjusts the restart intervals, which can help escape local minima more effectively.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `256`
   - **Reason**: A lower LUBYFACTOR can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in finding solutions faster. However, setting it too low can lead to excessive restarts, so a middle ground like 256 is often a good choice.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `500`
   - **Reason**: Since we are using `LubyRestarts`, this parameter is less critical. However, if you switch to `FixedPeriodRestarts`, a higher value like 500 can provide a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

4. **PHASE**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Reason**: This is already a good choice as it balances between positive and negative literals based on recent activity, which is generally effective.

5. **CLADECAY**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: A slightly higher decay factor can help in reducing the impact of older clauses more gradually, which can be beneficial for longer-running instances.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Reason**: A lower initial conflict bound can help in quickly identifying conflicts and restarting, which can speed up the solving process.

7. **VARDECAY**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`
   - **Reason**: A lower decay factor for variable activities can help in focusing on more recently active variables, which can improve the solver's efficiency.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.8`
   - **Reason**: A slightly lower increase factor can prevent the conflict bound from growing too quickly, which can help in maintaining a balanced search.

9. **SIMP**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: While `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` can be more thorough, it can also be very time-consuming. `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` provides a good balance between performance and effectiveness.

10. **CLEANING**:
    - **Optimized Value**: `LBD`
    - **Reason**: `LBD` (Literal Block Distance) is a more aggressive cleaning strategy that can help in removing less useful clauses, which can improve performance without significantly affecting solution quality.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 500
PHASE := 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.9
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the solver.
