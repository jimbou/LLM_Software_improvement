To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make the following adjustments based on the provided documentation and common practices in SAT solving:

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Rationale**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective than Glucose21Restarts because it balances exploration and exploitation well, often leading to faster convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: 256
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the Luby factor from 512 to 256 can help in achieving more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial in finding solutions faster without compromising the quality of the search.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: 50
   - **Rationale**: If using the FixedPeriod strategy, reducing the period from 100 to 50 can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to better performance by escaping local minima more quickly.

4. **PHASE**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Rationale**: RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy is a good default choice as it balances between positive and negative literals effectively. However, if specific problem characteristics suggest otherwise, consider testing other strategies like `PhaseInLastLearnedClauseSelectionStrategy`.

5. **CLADECAY**: 0.995
   - **Rationale**: Slightly increasing the clause decay factor from 0.999 to 0.995 can help in reducing the influence of older clauses more quickly, potentially improving the solver's ability to adapt to new information.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Lowering the initial conflict bound from 100 to 50 can help the solver start with a more aggressive approach, which can be beneficial in early stages of solving.

7. **VARDECAY**: 0.9
   - **Rationale**: Decreasing the variable decay factor from 0.95 to 0.9 can help in more rapidly reducing the activity of variables that have not been involved in recent conflicts, thus focusing the search on more relevant variables.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: 1.8
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the conflict bound increase factor from 2.0 to 1.8 can help in achieving a more gradual increase in the conflict bound, which can be more effective in some problem instances.

9. **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Rationale**: Using `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` instead of `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` can reduce the overhead of simplification steps, which can be beneficial for runtime performance, especially in problems where the expensive simplification does not provide significant benefits.

10. **CLEANING**: `LBD`
    - **Rationale**: Switching from `LBD2` to `LBD` can provide a more balanced approach to clause cleaning, potentially leading to better performance by removing less useful clauses more frequently.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.9
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the SAT solver. It is always recommended to test these configurations on a representative set of problem instances to ensure they provide the desired improvements.
