### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on the solver's efficiency. These include the restart strategy, phase selection strategy, decay factors, and simplification levels.

#### 1. **RESTARTS**
- **Current Value**: `Glucose21Restarts`
- **Impact**: Restart strategies can significantly affect the solver's ability to escape local minima and find solutions more efficiently.
- **Optimization**: We might consider using `LubyRestarts` as it is known to perform well across a variety of problem instances.

#### 2. **LUBYFACTOR**
- **Current Value**: `512`
- **Impact**: This factor influences the frequency of restarts in the Luby strategy. A higher value means less frequent restarts, which can be beneficial for certain problem types.
- **Optimization**: We can try reducing this value to `256` to see if more frequent restarts help in escaping local minima more effectively.

#### 3. **FIXEDPERIOD**
- **Current Value**: `100`
- **Impact**: Only relevant if `FixedPeriodRestarts` is selected. Since we are not using this strategy, this parameter can be ignored.

#### 4. **PHASE**
- **Current Value**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
- **Impact**: Phase selection can influence the solver's ability to make good decisions early in the search process.
- **Optimization**: We can try `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy` as it uses information from recently learned clauses, which can be more effective.

#### 5. **CLADECAY**
- **Current Value**: `0.999`
- **Impact**: A lower decay factor can help in maintaining the importance of older clauses, while a higher factor can help in focusing on more recent clauses.
- **Optimization**: We can slightly increase this to `0.995` to give a bit more weight to recent clauses.

#### 6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**
- **Current Value**: `100`
- **Impact**: The initial conflict bound can affect how quickly the solver starts making restarts.
- **Optimization**: We can reduce this to `50` to encourage more frequent initial restarts, which can help in exploring the search space more thoroughly.

#### 7. **VARDECAY**
- **Current Value**: `0.95`
- **Impact**: Variable activity decay affects how the solver prioritizes variables during the search.
- **Optimization**: We can keep this value as is, as it is generally a good balance between focusing on recent and older variables.

#### 8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**
- **Current Value**: `2.0`
- **Impact**: This factor determines how much the conflict bound increases after each restart. A higher value can lead to fewer but more impactful restarts.
- **Optimization**: We can try increasing this to `2.5` to see if it helps in making each restart more effective.

#### 9. **SIMP**
- **Current Value**: `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`
- **Impact**: Simplification can reduce the size of the problem, but it can also add overhead.
- **Optimization**: We can try `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` to reduce the overhead while still benefiting from some level of simplification.

#### 10. **CLEANING**
- **Current Value**: `LBD2`
- **Impact**: Clause cleaning strategies can help in managing memory usage and improving the solver's performance.
- **Optimization**: We can keep this as `LBD2` as it is a balanced approach.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 100
PHASE := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.95
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 2.5
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD2'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **RESTARTS**: Switching to `LubyRestarts` can provide a more adaptive restart strategy, which is often more effective than a fixed or less adaptive strategy.
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reducing the factor to `256` increases the frequency of restarts, which can help in escaping local minima more frequently.
3. **PHASE**: Using `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy` leverages information from recently learned clauses, potentially leading to better decision-making.
4. **CLADECAY**: Slightly increasing the decay factor to `0.995` gives more weight to recent clauses, which can improve the solver's focus on recent progress.
5. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reducing the initial conflict bound to `50` encourages more frequent initial restarts, which can help in exploring the search space more thoroughly.
6. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Increasing this to `2.5` makes each restart more impactful, potentially leading to better performance.
7. **SIMP**: Switching to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` reduces the overhead while still providing some level of simplification, which can improve overall performance.

These changes aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and improve the solver's ability to find solutions more efficiently.
