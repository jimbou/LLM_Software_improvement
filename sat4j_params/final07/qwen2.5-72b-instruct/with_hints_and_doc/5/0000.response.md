To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are the optimized suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**
   - **Current Value**: `Glucose21Restarts`
   - **Optimized Value**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Rationale**: The Luby restart strategy is known to be more adaptive and often leads to better performance across a variety of problem instances compared to fixed strategies.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**
   - **Current Value**: `512`
   - **Optimized Value**: `256`
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the Luby factor can help in reducing the frequency of restarts, which might lead to faster convergence for some problems.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `N/A` (since we are using `LubyRestarts`)
   - **Rationale**: This parameter is not applicable when using the Luby restart strategy.

4. **PHASE**
   - **Current Value**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Optimized Value**: `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Rationale**: Using the last learned clauses for phase selection can often lead to more informed decisions, potentially reducing the number of conflicts and improving performance.

5. **CLADECAY**
   - **Current Value**: `0.999`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly lower decay factor can help in more quickly forgetting less useful clauses, which can improve performance by reducing the overhead of managing a large number of clauses.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Rationale**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to faster convergence.

7. **VARDECAY**
   - **Current Value**: `0.95`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`
   - **Rationale**: A lower decay factor for variable activities can help in more quickly focusing on the most relevant variables, potentially reducing the search space and improving performance.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**
   - **Current Value**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`
   - **Rationale**: A smaller increase factor can help in more controlled growth of the conflict bound, which can prevent over-aggressive restarts and maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.

9. **SIMP**
   - **Current Value**: `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Optimized Value**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Rationale**: While expensive simplification can sometimes lead to more optimal solutions, it comes at a high computational cost. Simple simplification strikes a better balance between performance and solution quality.

10. **CLEANING**
    - **Current Value**: `LBD2`
    - **Optimized Value**: `LBD`
    - **Rationale**: The LBD strategy is generally more efficient than LBD2, as it involves fewer computations and can help in maintaining a cleaner set of clauses.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := N/A
PHASE := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.9
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.5
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the overall functionality of the system. Always test these configurations on a representative set of problem instances to ensure they provide the desired performance improvements.
