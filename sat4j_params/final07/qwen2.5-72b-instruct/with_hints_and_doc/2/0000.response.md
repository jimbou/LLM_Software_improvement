To optimize the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Based on the provided documentation, here are the optimized settings:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective and adaptive compared to fixed period or other strategies. It balances exploration and exploitation well, leading to better performance on average.
   
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: `256`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the Luby factor from 512 to 256 can help in achieving a balance between the frequency of restarts and the depth of search, potentially reducing the overall runtime.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: `100` (unchanged)
   - **Reason**: Since we are switching to `LubyRestarts`, this parameter will not be used. However, if you decide to use `FixedPeriodRestarts`, the value of 100 is reasonable and can be kept as is.

4. **PHASE**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` (unchanged)
   - **Reason**: This strategy is typically effective and does not need to be changed unless specific benchmarks show otherwise. It balances the selection of literals based on recent activities.

5. **CLADECAY**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: Slightly increasing the clause decay factor from 0.999 to 0.995 can help in more frequent updates to clause activities, potentially improving the solver's ability to forget less useful clauses and focus on more relevant ones.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound from 100 to 50 can help the solver to restart more frequently at the beginning, which can sometimes lead to faster convergence on solutions.

7. **VARDECAY**: `0.97`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the variable decay factor from 0.95 to 0.97 can help in more frequent updates to variable activities, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on more relevant variables.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: `1.8`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the conflict bound increase factor from 2.0 to 1.8 can help in a more gradual increase of the conflict bound, potentially leading to a more stable and efficient search process.

9. **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: Switching from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` can significantly reduce the overhead associated with simplification, which can improve runtime performance without significantly impacting the quality of the solution.

10. **CLEANING**: `LBD`
    - **Reason**: Using `LBD` (Literal Block Distance) for clause cleaning is generally more efficient than `LBD2` and can help in maintaining a cleaner and more manageable set of clauses, leading to better performance.

### Summary of Changes:
- **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts`
- **LUBYFACTOR**: `256`
- **CLADECAY**: `0.995`
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: `50`
- **VARDECAY**: `0.97`
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: `1.8`
- **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
- **CLEANING**: `LBD`

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. It's always a good idea to test these configurations on a representative set of benchmarks to ensure they perform well in your specific use case.
