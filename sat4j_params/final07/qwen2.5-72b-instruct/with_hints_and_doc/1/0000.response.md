To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are the optimized settings with explanations:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is known for its effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation, often leading to faster convergence. It's generally more adaptive than fixed period or no restarts.
   
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: `256`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the Luby factor can help in speeding up the restarts, which can be beneficial in finding solutions faster. A value of 256 is a good balance between too frequent and too infrequent restarts.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: `500`
   - **Reason**: If you decide to stick with `FixedPeriodRestarts`, increasing the period slightly can allow more time for the solver to explore the search space before restarting, potentially reducing the number of unnecessary restarts.

4. **PHASE**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Reason**: This strategy is generally effective as it balances between positive and negative literals, which can lead to better performance in many cases. However, if specific instances are known to benefit from other strategies, they should be tested.

5. **CLADECAY**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause decay factor can help in retaining more information about the clauses, which can be useful in guiding the search more effectively.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in identifying conflicts earlier, which can speed up the solving process. However, it should not be set too low to avoid premature restarts.

7. **VARDECAY**: `0.9`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the variable decay factor can help in focusing more on recently active variables, which can lead to more efficient search.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: `1.8`
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the factor by which the conflict bound increases can help in managing the restarts more effectively, avoiding overly aggressive increases in the conflict bound.

9. **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: Using a less expensive simplification strategy can reduce the overhead of simplification steps, which can be particularly beneficial for large or complex instances.

10. **CLEANING**: `LBD`
    - **Reason**: The LBD (Literal Block Distance) cleaning strategy is generally more effective and less computationally intensive compared to `LBD2`. It helps in maintaining a cleaner clause database without excessive overhead.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 500
PHASE := 'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.9
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

### Additional Considerations:
- **Instance-Specific Tuning**: The optimal settings can vary depending on the specific problem instance. It is recommended to perform some empirical testing to fine-tune these parameters further.
- **Monitoring Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of the solver with these settings and adjust as necessary based on the results.

By applying these changes, you should see an improvement in the runtime performance of your system while maintaining its functionality.
