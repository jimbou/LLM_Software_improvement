To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s a suggested optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**:
   - **Current Value**: `Glucose21Restarts`
   - **Optimized Value**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Rationale**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective in solving hard instances by dynamically adjusting the restart intervals, which can lead to faster convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - **Current Value**: `512`
   - **Optimized Value**: `256`
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the Luby factor can help in more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial for certain types of problems. A value of 256 is a good balance between frequent and less frequent restarts.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Rationale**: If using the `FixedPeriodRestarts` strategy, reducing the fixed period can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes improve performance by avoiding getting stuck in local minima.

4. **PHASE**:
   - **Current Value**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Optimized Value**: `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Rationale**: Using the last learned clauses for phase selection can often lead to better decisions, especially in complex problems where recent information is more relevant.

5. **CLADECAY**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.999`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly lower decay factor for clause activities can help in more aggressive forgetting of old clauses, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Rationale**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in more frequent restarts initially, which can help in quickly exploring different parts of the search space.

7. **VARDECAY**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.95`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.97`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly higher decay factor for variable activities can help in retaining more information about variable importance, which can lead to better decision-making.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - **Current Value**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.8`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly lower increase factor for the conflict bound can help in more controlled growth, which can prevent the solver from becoming too aggressive too quickly.

9. **SIMP**:
   - **Current Value**: `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Optimized Value**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Rationale**: While expensive simplification can be thorough, it can also be time-consuming. Simple simplification can still provide good results with less overhead.

10. **CLEANING**:
    - **Current Value**: `LBD2`
    - **Optimized Value**: `LBD`
    - **Rationale**: The LBD strategy is generally more efficient and can help in maintaining a cleaner set of clauses without excessive overhead.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.97
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the overall functionality and effectiveness of the system.
