To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis and suggested improvements:

### Analysis of Critical Parameters

1. **RESTARTS**
   - **Impact**: Restart strategies can significantly affect the solver's ability to escape local minima and find solutions more efficiently.
   - **Optimization**: `Glucose21Restarts` is generally a good choice, but `LubyRestarts` can be more effective in some cases due to its adaptive nature. We will test both and choose the one that performs better.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**
   - **Impact**: This factor affects the frequency of restarts in the Luby strategy. A higher value can lead to fewer but more impactful restarts.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing this value might help in reducing the number of unnecessary restarts, potentially improving performance. We can try setting it to `256`.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**
   - **Impact**: Only relevant if using `FixedPeriodRestarts`. A lower value can lead to more frequent restarts, which might help in escaping local minima but can also increase overhead.
   - **Optimization**: If using `FixedPeriodRestarts`, a value of `50` could be a good starting point to balance between frequent restarts and overhead.

4. **PHASE**
   - **Impact**: Phase selection can influence the initial assignment of literals, affecting the search space exploration.
   - **Optimization**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` is generally effective, but `RandomLiteralSelectionStrategy` can sometimes provide better results by introducing randomness. We will test both.

5. **CLADECAY**
   - **Impact**: Affects how quickly clause activities decay, influencing the importance of older clauses.
   - **Optimization**: A slightly higher decay rate can help in focusing on more recent clauses, potentially improving performance. We can try setting it to `0.995`.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**
   - **Impact**: Determines the initial threshold for conflicts before a restart occurs.
   - **Optimization**: A lower initial conflict bound can help in triggering restarts more frequently, which might be beneficial. We can set it to `50`.

7. **VARDECAY**
   - **Impact**: Affects how quickly variable activities decay, influencing the importance of older variables.
   - **Optimization**: A slightly higher decay rate can help in focusing on more recent variables, potentially improving performance. We can try setting it to `0.96`.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**
   - **Impact**: Determines how much the conflict bound increases after each restart.
   - **Optimization**: A moderate increase factor can help in balancing between too frequent and too infrequent restarts. We can set it to `1.8`.

9. **SIMP**
   - **Impact**: Simplification can reduce the problem size, but more expensive simplifications can add overhead.
   - **Optimization**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` is a good balance between performance and effectiveness. We will use this instead of `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`.

10. **CLEANING**
    - **Impact**: Clause cleaning helps in managing memory usage and keeping the search space manageable.
    - **Optimization**: `LBD` is generally effective and less aggressive than `LBD2`, which can reduce overhead. We will use `LBD`.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'RandomLiteralSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.96
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.8
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD'
```

### Summary of Changes
- **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts` for adaptive restarts.
- **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from `512` to `256` to reduce unnecessary restarts.
- **FIXEDPERIOD**: Set to `50` for a balanced frequency of restarts.
- **PHASE**: Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `RandomLiteralSelectionStrategy` to introduce randomness.
- **CLADECAY**: Increased from `0.999` to `0.995` to focus on recent clauses.
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from `100` to `50` to trigger restarts more frequently.
- **VARDECAY**: Increased from `0.95` to `0.96` to focus on recent variables.
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.8` for a more moderate increase.
- **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` to reduce overhead.
- **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD` for less aggressive cleaning.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. It is recommended to test these configurations with a representative set of problems to ensure they meet the performance goals.
