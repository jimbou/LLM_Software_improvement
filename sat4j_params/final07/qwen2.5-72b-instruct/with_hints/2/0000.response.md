To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**: The restart strategy can significantly affect performance. `Glucose21Restarts` is a good choice, but we can also consider other strategies like `LubyRestarts` which might offer better performance in certain scenarios.
   - **Suggested Value**: `LubyRestarts`

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: This factor controls the aggressiveness of the Luby restart strategy. A lower value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima but may also increase overhead.
   - **Suggested Value**: 256 (reduced from 512 to balance between frequent restarts and overhead)

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: The fixed period for restarts. A higher value can lead to longer runs without restarts, which might be beneficial in some cases but can also lead to getting stuck in local optima.
   - **Suggested Value**: 50 (reduced from 100 to encourage more frequent restarts)

4. **PHASE**: The phase selection strategy can influence the solver's ability to make good decisions early on.
   - **Suggested Value**: `PolarityBasedPhaseSelectionStrategy` (often provides better performance than `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`)

5. **CLADECAY**: The clause decay factor controls how quickly learned clauses are forgotten. A slightly higher value can help retain more useful clauses.
   - **Suggested Value**: 0.998 (slightly increased from 0.999 to retain more clauses)

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: The initial conflict bound can affect how aggressively the solver tries to find conflicts early on.
   - **Suggested Value**: 50 (reduced from 100 to encourage earlier conflict detection)

7. **VARDECAY**: The variable decay factor controls how quickly variable activities are decayed. A higher value can help the solver focus on more recent activities.
   - **Suggested Value**: 0.96 (slightly increased from 0.95 to focus more on recent activities)

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: The factor by which the conflict bound is increased after each restart. A higher value can lead to more aggressive conflict detection.
   - **Suggested Value**: 1.5 (reduced from 2.0 to balance between aggressive and conservative conflict detection)

9. **SIMP**: The simplification strategy can significantly impact performance. `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` is thorough but can be time-consuming.
   - **Suggested Value**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION` (less expensive but still effective)

10. **CLEANING**: The cleaning strategy can help manage memory usage and improve performance by removing less useful clauses.
    - **Suggested Value**: `LBD3` (a bit more aggressive than `LBD2` to remove more clauses)

### Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 256
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'PolarityBasedPhaseSelectionStrategy'
CLADECAY := 0.998
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.96
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.5
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD3'
```

These changes aim to balance between performance and the effectiveness of the solver, ensuring that the system remains functional while reducing runtime.
