To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**:
   - **Current Value**: `Glucose21Restarts`
   - **Optimized Value**: `LubyRestarts`
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy is generally more effective and can help in escaping local minima more efficiently, leading to faster convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - **Current Value**: `512`
   - **Optimized Value**: `64`
   - **Reason**: A lower Luby factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in finding solutions faster. However, it should not be too low to avoid excessive restarts.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the fixed period can help in more frequent updates and potentially faster convergence.

4. **PHASE**:
   - **Current Value**: `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy`
   - **Optimized Value**: `JeroslowWangPhaseSelection`
   - **Reason**: The Jeroslow-Wang phase selection strategy is often more efficient and can lead to better performance in many cases.

5. **CLADECAY**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.999`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: A slightly higher decay rate can help in reducing the weight of older clauses more quickly, which can improve performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help in reducing the number of conflicts early in the solving process, leading to faster initial progress.

7. **VARDECAY**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.95`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.98`
   - **Reason**: A slightly higher variable decay rate can help in maintaining a more balanced activity score, which can improve the solver's ability to make good decisions.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**:
   - **Current Value**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`
   - **Reason**: A lower increment factor can help in more controlled growth of the conflict bound, which can lead to better performance.

9. **SIMP**:
   - **Current Value**: `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Optimized Value**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
   - **Reason**: Expensive simplification can be time-consuming. Using a simpler simplification strategy can reduce overhead and improve runtime performance.

10. **CLEANING**:
    - **Current Value**: `LBD2`
    - **Optimized Value**: `LBD3`
    - **Reason**: Increasing the LBD threshold can help in removing more clauses that are less useful, which can improve performance by reducing the size of the clause database.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
RESTARTS := 'LubyRestarts'
LUBYFACTOR := 64
FIXEDPERIOD := 50
PHASE := 'JeroslowWangPhaseSelection'
CLADECAY := 0.995
INITCONFLICTBOUND := 50
VARDECAY := 0.98
CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR := 1.5
SIMP := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
CLEANING := 'LBD3'
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. Always test the optimized configuration with your specific workload to ensure that the performance improvements meet your requirements.
