To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters with explanations:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestart`
- **LUBYFACTOR**: 64
- **FIXEDPERIOD**: 50
- **PHASE**: `RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy`
- **CLADECAY**: 0.998
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: 50
- **VARDECAY**: 0.97
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: 1.5
- **SIMP**: `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`
- **CLEANING**: `LBD3`

### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Changed from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestart`. The Luby restart strategy is known to be more effective in many cases, as it dynamically adjusts the restart intervals based on the problem's complexity, which can lead to faster convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reduced from 512 to 64. A lower factor can help in more frequent restarts, which can prevent the solver from getting stuck in unproductive search paths.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A shorter fixed period can help in more frequent re-evaluations of the search space, potentially leading to faster convergence.

4. **PHASE**: Changed from `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` to `RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy`. Random phase selection can help in breaking symmetry and exploring different parts of the search space more effectively, which can sometimes lead to faster solutions.

5. **CLADECAY**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.998. A slightly lower clause decay factor can help in more aggressive pruning of less useful clauses, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A lower initial conflict bound can help in quicker identification of conflicts, which can speed up the solving process.

7. **VARDECAY**: Increased from 0.95 to 0.97. A higher variable decay factor can help in more gradual forgetting of variable activities, which can improve the solver's ability to adapt to changes in the search space.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. A lower increment factor can help in more controlled growth of the conflict bound, which can prevent over-aggressive increases that might slow down the solver.

9. **SIMP**: Changed from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`. Simple simplification is less computationally intensive and can help in reducing the overhead associated with complex simplification techniques, leading to faster performance.

10. **CLEANING**: Changed from `LBD2` to `LBD3`. A higher LBD (Literal Block Distance) threshold can help in more aggressive cleaning of learned clauses, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. However, it's always a good idea to test these configurations on a representative set of problems to ensure they provide the desired performance improvements.
