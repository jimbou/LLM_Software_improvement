To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the most critical parameters and adjust them accordingly. Here's an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **RESTARTS**: `LubyRestarts` (This is generally more effective than `Glucose21Restarts` for a wide range of problems.)
- **LUBYFACTOR**: 64 (Reducing this value can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to faster solving times.)
- **FIXEDPERIOD**: 50 (A slightly lower value can help in more frequent adjustments, potentially improving performance.)
- **PHASE**: `VSIDSPhaseSelectionStrategy` (VSIDS is often more efficient than RSAT for many SAT solvers.)
- **CLADECAY**: 0.998 (A slight decrease can help in more aggressive clause decay, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.)
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: 50 (Lowering this can help in quicker initial conflict detection and resolution.)
- **VARDECAY**: 0.97 (A slightly higher value can help in more stable variable selection, which can improve performance.)
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: 1.5 (A lower factor can help in more controlled increases in the conflict bound, potentially reducing unnecessary work.)
- **SIMP**: `CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION` (This is less computationally expensive and can be more efficient for many instances.)
- **CLEANING**: `LBD3` (A slightly higher LBD threshold can help in more aggressive cleaning, which can reduce memory overhead.)

### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Switching from `Glucose21Restarts` to `LubyRestarts` can provide a more balanced and effective restart strategy, which is generally beneficial for a wide range of problem instances.
2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reducing the Luby factor to 64 allows for more frequent restarts, which can help in escaping local minima and finding solutions faster.
3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Lowering the fixed period to 50 can help in more frequent adjustments, which can be beneficial for dynamic problem solving.
4. **PHASE**: Using `VSIDSPhaseSelectionStrategy` instead of `RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy` can lead to more efficient variable selection and phase decisions.
5. **CLADECAY**: Slightly decreasing the clause decay factor to 0.998 can help in more aggressive clause decay, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Lowering the initial conflict bound to 50 can help in quicker initial conflict detection and resolution, potentially speeding up the solving process.
7. **VARDECAY**: Increasing the variable decay factor to 0.97 can help in more stable variable selection, which can improve overall performance.
8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reducing the conflict bound increase factor to 1.5 can help in more controlled increases, potentially reducing unnecessary work.
9. **SIMP**: Switching from `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` to `CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION` can significantly reduce computational overhead while still providing effective simplification.
10. **CLEANING**: Using `LBD3` instead of `LBD2` can help in more aggressive cleaning, reducing memory overhead and potentially improving performance.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system.
