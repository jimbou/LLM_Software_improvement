To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on key areas such as restart strategies, phase selection, clause and variable decay, and simplification techniques. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **RESTARTS**: `'LubyRestarts'`
- **LUBYFACTOR**: `64`
- **FIXEDPERIOD**: `50`
- **PHASE**: `'RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy'`
- **CLADECAY**: `0.998`
- **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: `50`
- **VARDECAY**: `0.97`
- **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: `1.5`
- **SIMP**: `'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'`
- **CLEANING**: `'LBD3'`

### Explanation:
1. **RESTARTS**: Switching from `'Glucose21Restarts'` to `'LubyRestarts'` can help in managing the search space more efficiently. Luby restarts are known to be effective in reducing the number of conflicts and improving convergence.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**: Reducing `LUBYFACTOR` from `512` to `64` can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in escaping local minima and potentially finding solutions faster.

3. **FIXEDPERIOD**: Lowering `FIXEDPERIOD` from `100` to `50` can make the solver more responsive to changes in the search space, leading to quicker convergence.

4. **PHASE**: Changing from `'RSATPhaseSelectionStrategy'` to `'RandomPhaseSelectionStrategy'` can introduce more randomness into the decision-making process, which can help in breaking symmetries and avoiding getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.

5. **CLADECAY**: Slightly reducing `CLADECAY` from `0.999` to `0.998` can help in more aggressively removing less useful clauses, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

6. **INITCONFLICTBOUND**: Lowering `INITCONFLICTBOUND` from `100` to `50` can help in starting with a lower initial conflict bound, which can speed up the early stages of the solving process.

7. **VARDECAY**: Increasing `VARDECAY` from `0.95` to `0.97` can slow down the decay of variable activities, which can help in maintaining a more stable search direction.

8. **CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR**: Reducing `CONFLICTBOUNDINCFACTOR` from `2.0` to `1.5` can make the increase in the conflict bound more gradual, which can help in balancing exploration and exploitation.

9. **SIMP**: Switching from `'EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION'` to `'CHEAP_SIMPLIFICATION'` can reduce the overhead of simplification steps, which can improve overall runtime performance.

10. **CLEANING**: Changing from `'LBD2'` to `'LBD3'` can provide a more aggressive cleaning strategy, which can help in keeping the clause database smaller and more manageable.

These adjustments should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. Always test the new configuration to ensure it meets the desired performance and correctness criteria.
