To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that significantly affect the solver's efficiency. Here are the key parameters and suggested adjustments:

### Core Parameters

1. **luby**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.0` (No change)
   - **Rationale**: The Luby restart strategy can be effective but is often not necessary for many instances. Keeping it at `0.0` avoids unnecessary overhead.

2. **rnd-init**:
   - **Current Value**: `False`
   - **Optimized Value**: `False` (No change)
   - **Rationale**: Random initialization can sometimes help escape local minima but generally increases runtime. Keeping it `False` is safer for performance.

3. **gc-frac**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.2`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.1`
   - **Rationale**: A lower garbage collection fraction can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, potentially improving performance.

4. **rinc**:
   - **Current Value**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`
   - **Rationale**: A smaller restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in escaping local minima without overly increasing runtime.

5. **var-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.8`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`
   - **Rationale**: A higher variable activity decay factor can help in reducing the influence of older decisions, potentially leading to faster convergence.

6. **lbd-cut**:
   - **Current Value**: `5.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `4.0`
   - **Rationale**: A lower LBD cutoff value can reduce the number of clauses retained, which can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

7. **lbd-cut-max**:
   - **Current Value**: `10.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `8.0`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly lower maximum LBD cutoff value can further reduce memory usage and improve performance.

8. **cla-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.999`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Rationale**: A slightly lower clause activity decay factor can help in reducing the influence of older clauses, potentially leading to faster convergence.

9. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.0` (No change)
   - **Rationale**: Random variable selection can increase runtime without significant benefits in most cases.

10. **rnd-seed**:
    - **Current Value**: `91648253`
    - **Optimized Value**: `91648253` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: The seed value does not directly impact performance but ensures reproducibility.

11. **phase-saving**:
    - **Current Value**: `2`
    - **Optimized Value**: `2` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Phase saving helps in maintaining good decisions and should be kept as is.

12. **ccmin-mode**:
    - **Current Value**: `2`
    - **Optimized Value**: `2` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Conflict clause minimization mode `2` is generally effective and should be kept as is.

13. **rfirst**:
    - **Current Value**: `100`
    - **Optimized Value**: `50`
    - **Rationale**: A lower number of conflicts before the first restart can help in more frequent restarts, potentially improving performance.

14. **cp-increase**:
    - **Current Value**: `15000`
    - **Optimized Value**: `10000`
    - **Rationale**: A lower increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help in reducing the number of clauses retained, potentially improving performance.

### Main Parameters

15. **pre**:
    - **Current Value**: `True`
    - **Optimized Value**: `True` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Preprocessing is crucial for reducing the problem size and should be enabled.

16. **verb**:
    - **Current Value**: `1`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0`
    - **Rationale**: Reducing verbosity can reduce I/O operations and improve performance.

### Simplification Parameters

17. **rcheck**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Checking for satisfied clauses during simplification can be expensive and is not necessary for most instances.

18. **asymm**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Asymmetric branching can increase complexity and is not necessary for most instances.

19. **elim**:
    - **Current Value**: `True`
    - **Optimized Value**: `True` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Variable elimination is crucial for reducing the problem size and should be enabled.

20. **simp-gc-frac**:
    - **Current Value**: `0.5`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0.3`
    - **Rationale**: A lower garbage collection fraction during simplification can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, potentially improving performance.

21. **grow**:
    - **Current Value**: `0`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Controlling variable growth is not necessary in this context.

22. **@sub-lim$flag**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Using a bounded subsumption limit can be expensive and is not necessary for most instances.

23. **sub-lim$bounded**:
    - **Current Value**: `1000`
    - **Optimized Value**: `1000` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: The bounded subsumption limit is already set to a reasonable value.

24. **@cl-lim$flag**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: Using a bounded clause learning limit can be expensive and is not necessary for most instances.

25. **cl-lim$bounded**:
    - **Current Value**: `20`
    - **Optimized Value**: `20` (No change)
    - **Rationale**: The bounded clause learning limit is already set to a reasonable value.
