To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that significantly affect the solver's efficiency. Here are the key parameters and suggested adjustments:

### Core Parameters

1. **luby**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.1`
   - **Reason**: A small non-zero value can help in breaking symmetry and improving convergence, especially for complex problems.

2. **rnd-init**:
   - **Current Value**: `False`
   - **Optimized Value**: `True`
   - **Reason**: Random initialization can help escape local minima and improve the exploration of the solution space.

3. **gc-frac**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.2`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.3`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively, reducing the overhead of frequent garbage collection.

4. **rinc**:
   - **Current Value**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`
   - **Reason**: A lower restart increment factor can help the solver converge faster by restarting more frequently, which can be beneficial for certain problem types.

5. **var-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.8`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`
   - **Reason**: A higher variable activity decay factor can help maintain a more balanced activity distribution, potentially leading to better performance.

6. **lbd-cut**:
   - **Current Value**: `5.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `4.0`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the LBD cutoff can help filter out less useful clauses more aggressively, improving performance.

7. **lbd-cut-max**:
   - **Current Value**: `10.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `8.0`
   - **Reason**: Similarly, reducing the maximum LBD cutoff can further enhance clause management and performance.

8. **cla-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.999`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.99`
   - **Reason**: A slightly lower clause activity decay factor can help in more dynamic clause management, potentially improving performance.

9. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.05`
   - **Reason**: Introducing a small frequency of random variable selection can help in exploring different parts of the search space, which can be beneficial for hard problems.

10. **rfirst**:
    - **Current Value**: `100`
    - **Optimized Value**: `50`
    - **Reason**: Reducing the number of conflicts before the first restart can help the solver converge faster.

11. **cp-increase**:
    - **Current Value**: `15,000`
    - **Optimized Value**: `10,000`
    - **Reason**: A lower increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help in more frequent and effective clause management.

### Main Parameters

12. **pre**:
    - **Current Value**: `True`
    - **Optimized Value**: `True`
    - **Reason**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled.

13. **verb**:
    - **Current Value**: `1`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0`
    - **Reason**: Reducing verbosity can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

### Simplification Parameters

14. **rcheck**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False`
    - **Reason**: Checking for satisfied clauses during simplification can be expensive and is often not necessary.

15. **asymm**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False`
    - **Reason**: Asymmetric branching is an advanced feature that can sometimes slow down the solver. It is best to keep it disabled unless specifically needed.

16. **elim**:
    - **Current Value**: `True`
    - **Optimized Value**: `True`
    - **Reason**: Variable elimination is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled.

17. **simp-gc-frac**:
    - **Current Value**: `0.5`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0.6`
    - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction during simplification can help manage memory more effectively.

18. **grow**:
    - **Current Value**: `0`
    - **Optimized Value**: `0`
    - **Reason**: Controlling variable growth is not necessary in most cases and can be left at the default value.

19. **@sub-lim$flag**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False`
    - **Reason**: Using a bounded subsumption limit can be more efficient than an unbounded one.

20. **sub-lim$bounded**:
    - **Current Value**: `1,000`
    - **Optimized Value**: `500`
    - **Reason**: Reducing the subsumption limit can help in faster clause management and performance.

21. **@cl-lim$flag**:
    - **Current Value**: `False`
    - **Optimized Value**: `False`
    - **Reason**: Using a bounded clause learning limit can be more efficient than an unbounded one.

22. **cl-lim$bounded**:
    - **Current Value**: `20`
    - **Optimized Value**: `10`
    - **Reason**: Reducing the clause learning limit can help in faster clause management and performance.
