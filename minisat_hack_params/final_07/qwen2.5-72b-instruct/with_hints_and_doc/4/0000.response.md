To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we will focus on the most critical parameters and suggest adjustments. Here are the key areas to consider:

1. **Restart Strategy and Frequency**:
   - **luby**: The Luby restart strategy can help in escaping local minima but may increase the overall runtime if not used judiciously. A value of `0.0` means the Luby strategy is disabled. We can try enabling it with a small value to see if it improves performance.
   - **rinc**: The restart increment factor controls how quickly the restart interval increases. A higher value can lead to more frequent restarts, which might be beneficial for certain problem types. However, a value of `2.0` is generally a good starting point. We can slightly increase this to `2.5` to see if it helps.
   - **rfirst**: The number of conflicts before the first restart. A lower value can help in faster initial exploration. We can reduce this from `100` to `50`.

2. **Variable and Clause Activity Management**:
   - **var-decay**: The variable activity decay factor. A higher decay factor can lead to more frequent updates, which might slow down the solver. We can keep it at `0.8` as it is a balanced value.
   - **cla-decay**: The clause activity decay factor. Similar to `var-decay`, a higher decay factor can slow down the solver. We can keep it at `0.999` as it is a good balance between activity update frequency and performance.
   - **lbd-cut** and **lbd-cut-max**: These parameters control the lower bound distance (LBD) cutoff values. Higher values can lead to more aggressive pruning, which might improve performance. We can increase `lbd-cut` from `5.0` to `6.0` and `lbd-cut-max` from `10.0` to `12.0`.

3. **Randomization and Initialization**:
   - **rnd-init**: Random initialization can sometimes help in breaking symmetry and improving performance. We can enable it by setting `rnd-init` to `True`.
   - **rnd-freq**: The frequency of random variable selection. A small value can help in introducing randomness without overwhelming the solver. We can set it to `0.05`.

4. **Preprocessing and Simplification**:
   - **pre**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled (`True`).
   - **elim**: Variable elimination can significantly reduce the problem size, so it should be kept enabled (`True`).
   - **simp-gc-frac**: The garbage collection fraction during simplification. A higher value can lead to more frequent garbage collection, which might slow down the solver. We can reduce it from `0.5` to `0.3`.

5. **Conflict Clause Minimization**:
   - **ccmin-mode**: Conflict clause minimization mode. Mode `2` is generally effective and should be kept as is.

6. **Verbosity and Debugging**:
   - **verb**: Verbosity level. For production runs, we can set it to `0` to reduce output and potentially improve performance.

7. **Hidden Parameters**:
   - **@sub-lim$flag** and **sub-lim$bounded**: We can enable the subsumption limit to prevent excessive subsumption checks, which can be costly. Set **@sub-lim$flag** to `True` and **sub-lim$bounded** to `5000`.
   - **@cl-lim$flag** and **cl-lim$bounded**: Similarly, we can enable the clause learning limit to prevent excessive clause learning. Set **@cl-lim$flag** to `True` and **cl-lim$bounded** to `100`.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **luby**: Enabled with a small value to potentially improve exploration.
- **rinc**: Increased slightly to allow for more frequent restarts.
- **rfirst**: Reduced to speed up initial exploration.
- **lbd-cut** and **lbd-cut-max**: Increased to allow for more aggressive pruning.
- **rnd-init**: Enabled to introduce randomness and break symmetry.
- **rnd-freq**: Set to a small value to introduce some randomness without overwhelming the solver.
- **simp-gc-frac**: Reduced to decrease the frequency of garbage collection.
- **verb**: Set to `0` to reduce verbosity and improve performance.
- **@sub-lim$flag** and **sub-lim$bounded**: Enabled to prevent excessive subsumption checks.
- **@cl-lim$flag** and **cl-lim$bounded**: Enabled to prevent excessive clause learning.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration, pruning, and performance, while maintaining the functionality of the system.
