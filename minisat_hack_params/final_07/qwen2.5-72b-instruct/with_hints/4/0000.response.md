To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Critical Parameters and Their Optimizations:

1. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction):**
   - **Current Value:** 0.2
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.1
   - **Rationale:** Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help in reducing the overhead of garbage collection, which can improve performance. However, setting it too low might lead to increased memory usage, so 0.1 is a balanced value.

2. **rinc (Restart Increment):**
   - **Current Value:** 2.0
   - **Optimized Value:** 1.5
   - **Rationale:** A lower restart increment can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to better performance by avoiding getting stuck in long, unproductive search paths.

3. **var-decay (Variable Decay):**
   - **Current Value:** 0.8
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.9
   - **Rationale:** Increasing the variable decay rate can help in maintaining a more balanced activity score, which can improve the solver's ability to make good decisions.

4. **lbd-cut (Learned Clause Deletion Based on LBD):**
   - **Current Value:** 5.0
   - **Optimized Value:** 3.0
   - **Rationale:** Lowering the LBD cut can help in removing less useful clauses more aggressively, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

5. **cla-decay (Clause Decay):**
   - **Current Value:** 0.999
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.99
   - **Rationale:** Slightly increasing the clause decay rate can help in reducing the weight of older clauses, which can improve the solver's ability to adapt to new information.

6. **elim (Variable Elimination):**
   - **Current Value:** True
   - **Optimized Value:** False
   - **Rationale:** Variable elimination can be computationally expensive. Disabling it might reduce runtime, especially for large instances.

7. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction):**
   - **Current Value:** 0.5
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.3
   - **Rationale:** Reducing the simplification garbage collection fraction can help in reducing the overhead of garbage collection during the simplification process.

8. **cp-increase (Conflict Clause Increase):**
   - **Current Value:** 15000
   - **Optimized Value:** 10000
   - **Rationale:** Reducing the conflict clause increase threshold can help in managing the number of conflict clauses more efficiently, which can improve performance.

### Optimized Parameter Configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 3.0
lbd-cut-max := 10.0
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'False'
simp-gc-frac := 0.3
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
grow := 0
```

### Summary:
- **gc-frac** and **simp-gc-frac** have been reduced to decrease garbage collection overhead.
- **rinc** has been decreased to allow more frequent restarts.
- **var-decay** has been increased to maintain a more balanced activity score.
- **lbd-cut** has been lowered to remove less useful clauses more aggressively.
- **cla-decay** has been slightly increased to reduce the weight of older clauses.
- **elim** has been disabled to reduce computational expense.
- **cp-increase** has been reduced to manage conflict clauses more efficiently.

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance of the system while maintaining its functionality.
