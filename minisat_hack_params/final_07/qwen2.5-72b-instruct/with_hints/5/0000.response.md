To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on parameters that significantly impact the solver's efficiency, such as those related to garbage collection, clause management, and decision heuristics. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to trigger GC more frequently, potentially reducing memory overhead
rinc := 1.5     # Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to slow down the increase in the restart interval, which can help in finding solutions faster
var-decay := 0.95  # Increased from 0.8 to 0.95 to make the variable activity decay slower, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on important variables
lbd-cut := 4.0  # Reduced from 5.0 to 4.0 to cut off less useful learned clauses earlier, reducing memory usage
lbd-cut-max := 8.0  # Reduced from 10.0 to 8.0 to further control the maximum LBD cut-off
cla-decay := 0.995  # Increased from 0.999 to 0.995 to slightly speed up the decay of clause activities, helping to manage the clause database more effectively
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50    # Reduced from 100 to 50 to start with a smaller initial restart interval, which can help in finding solutions faster
cp-increase := 10000  # Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to decrease the frequency of conflict point increases, potentially improving performance
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.4  # Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4 to trigger simplification garbage collection more frequently, reducing memory overhead
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
grow := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`gc-frac := 0.1`**: Reducing this value triggers garbage collection more frequently, which can help manage memory usage more efficiently, especially in problems with a large number of clauses.

2. **`rinc := 1.5`**: Slowing down the increase in the restart interval can help the solver find solutions faster by allowing it to explore different parts of the search space more frequently.

3. **`var-decay := 0.95`**: Increasing the variable activity decay rate helps the solver maintain a more focused search on important variables, potentially improving performance.

4. **`lbd-cut := 4.0` and `lbd-cut-max := 8.0`**: Reducing these values helps cut off less useful learned clauses earlier, reducing memory usage and improving the solver's efficiency.

5. **`cla-decay := 0.995`**: Slightly increasing the clause activity decay rate helps manage the clause database more effectively, reducing the overhead of managing too many clauses.

6. **`rfirst := 50`**: Starting with a smaller initial restart interval can help the solver find solutions faster by exploring the search space more quickly.

7. **`cp-increase := 10000`**: Reducing the frequency of conflict point increases can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary overhead.

8. **`simp-gc-frac := 0.4`**: Triggering simplification garbage collection more frequently helps manage memory usage more effectively during the simplification process.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of the solver while maintaining its functionality.
