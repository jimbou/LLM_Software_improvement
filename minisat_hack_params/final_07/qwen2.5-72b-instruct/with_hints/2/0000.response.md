To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **gc-frac**: The garbage collection fraction can significantly affect memory usage and performance. A lower value can help reduce memory overhead but might increase the frequency of garbage collection. A value of `0.1` is often a good balance.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.1`

2. **cla-decay**: Clause decay rate affects how quickly learned clauses are forgotten. A higher decay rate can help in reducing memory usage and improving performance, but it might also lead to losing useful information.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.99`

3. **rinc**: Restart increment factor. A higher value can lead to more aggressive restarts, which can help escape local minima but might also increase the number of restarts.
   - **Suggested Value**: `1.5`

4. **var-decay**: Variable decay rate. A lower value can help in focusing on more recent variables, which can improve performance.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.9`

5. **lbd-cut** and **lbd-cut-max**: These parameters control the length of learned clauses. Reducing these values can help in reducing the number of large clauses, which can improve performance.
   - **Suggested Values**: `lbd-cut := 3.0`, `lbd-cut-max := 8.0`

6. **cp-increase**: This parameter controls the frequency of conflict clause learning. A higher value can help in learning more clauses, but it might also increase the computational overhead.
   - **Suggested Value**: `10000`

7. **elim**: Clause elimination can help in reducing the problem size, but it might also remove useful information. Disabling it can sometimes improve performance.
   - **Suggested Value**: `False`

8. **pre**: Preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance. Enabling it is generally beneficial.
   - **Suggested Value**: `True`

9. **simp-gc-frac**: Simplification garbage collection fraction. A lower value can help in reducing memory overhead.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.3`

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 3.0
lbd-cut-max := 8.0
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'False'
simp-gc-frac := 0.3
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
grow := 0
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. Always test the optimized configuration with your specific workload to ensure it meets your performance requirements.
