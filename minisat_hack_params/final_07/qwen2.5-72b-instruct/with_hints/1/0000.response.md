To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we can focus on parameters that significantly affect the solver's efficiency. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to decrease garbage collection overhead
rinc := 1.5     # Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to balance between exploration and exploitation
var-decay := 0.95  # Increased from 0.8 to 0.95 to slow down variable decay
lbd-cut := 5.0  # Kept the same as it is already a reasonable value
lbd-cut-max := 15.0  # Increased from 10.0 to 15.0 to allow more flexibility in clause management
cla-decay := 0.995  # Slightly reduced from 0.999 to 0.995 to speed up clause decay
rnd-freq := 0.0  # Kept the same as randomness is not beneficial here
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Kept the same as it is a seed value
phase-saving := 2  # Kept the same as it is a reasonable value for phase saving
ccmin-mode := 2  # Kept the same as it is a reasonable value for conflict clause minimization
rfirst := 100  # Kept the same as it is a reasonable initial restart value
cp-increase := 10000  # Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to speed up clause processing
pre := 'True'  # Kept the same as preprocessing is important for performance
verb := '1'  # Kept the same as it controls verbosity level
rcheck := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is a check flag
asymm := 'False'  # Kept the same as symmetry breaking is not enabled
elim := 'True'  # Kept the same as variable elimination is beneficial
simp-gc-frac := 0.4  # Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4 to decrease garbage collection overhead during simplification
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is a flag for subproblem limits
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is a flag for clause limits
grow := 0  # Kept the same as it controls dynamic growth
```

### Explanation:
1. **`gc-frac`**: Reducing this from 0.2 to 0.1 can help reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can improve performance by reducing overhead.
2. **`rinc`**: Lowering the restart increment from 2.0 to 1.5 can help balance between exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to faster convergence.
3. **`var-decay`**: Increasing this from 0.8 to 0.95 slows down the decay of variable activities, which can help maintain a more stable search process.
4. **`lbd-cut-max`**: Increasing this from 10.0 to 15.0 allows for more flexibility in managing learned clauses, which can be beneficial for complex problems.
5. **`cla-decay`**: Slightly reducing this from 0.999 to 0.995 can help speed up the decay of clauses, which can improve performance by reducing the number of irrelevant clauses.
6. **`cp-increase`**: Reducing this from 15000 to 10000 can speed up the processing of clauses, which can lead to faster solving times.
7. **`simp-gc-frac`**: Reducing this from 0.5 to 0.4 can help decrease the frequency of garbage collection during simplification, which can improve performance.

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the system's functionality and effectiveness.
