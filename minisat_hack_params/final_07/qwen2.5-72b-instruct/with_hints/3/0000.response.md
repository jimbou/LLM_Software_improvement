To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we can focus on several key areas such as garbage collection, variable and clause decay rates, restart strategies, and simplification techniques. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to decrease the frequency of garbage collection
rinc := 1.5     # Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to make restarts more frequent, potentially improving search efficiency
var-decay := 0.95  # Increased from 0.8 to 0.95 to slow down the decay of variable activities, helping in more stable variable selection
lbd-cut := 5.0  # Kept the same as it is already a reasonable value
lbd-cut-max := 10.0  # Kept the same as it is already a reasonable value
cla-decay := 0.999  # Kept the same as it is a good balance between keeping clauses and reducing memory usage
rnd-freq := 0.0  # Kept the same as random decisions are not used
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Kept the same as it does not affect performance but ensures reproducibility
phase-saving := 2  # Kept the same as it is a good balance between saving phases and flexibility
ccmin-mode := 2  # Kept the same as it is a good balance between clause minimization and performance
rfirst := 50     # Reduced from 100 to 50 to start with a smaller initial restart limit, which can help in finding solutions faster
cp-increase := 10000  # Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to decrease the growth rate of the conflict limit, making the solver more aggressive in finding conflicts
pre := 'True'    # Kept the same as preprocessing is beneficial for performance
verb := '1'      # Kept the same as it provides useful information without affecting performance
rcheck := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is not necessary for performance
asymm := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is not necessary for performance
elim := 'True'    # Kept the same as variable elimination can improve performance
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Kept the same as it is a good balance between simplification and garbage collection
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is not necessary for performance
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'  # Kept the same as it is not necessary for performance
grow := 0        # Kept the same as it is not necessary for performance
```

### Explanation:
1. **`gc-frac := 0.1`**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can significantly reduce the overhead associated with frequent garbage collection, leading to better runtime performance.
2. **`rinc := 1.5`**: A lower restart increment can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help the solver escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster.
3. **`var-decay := 0.95`**: Increasing the variable decay rate can help maintain a more stable and effective variable activity, which can improve the solver's decision-making process.
4. **`rfirst := 50`**: Starting with a smaller initial restart limit can help the solver quickly explore different parts of the search space, potentially leading to faster solution discovery.
5. **`cp-increase := 10000`**: Reducing the conflict limit growth rate can make the solver more aggressive in finding conflicts, which can improve performance by reducing the number of unnecessary searches.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality and effectiveness of the system.
