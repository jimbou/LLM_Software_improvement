### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that significantly influence the solver's behavior and efficiency. Here are the key parameters and their potential impact:

1. **luby**: The Luby restart strategy can help escape local minima but might increase the overall runtime if not configured properly.
2. **rnd-init**: Random initialization can help break symmetries and explore different parts of the search space, potentially reducing runtime.
3. **gc-frac**: A higher garbage collection fraction can reduce memory usage but may also increase the overhead of garbage collection.
4. **rinc**: The restart increment factor controls how often restarts occur. A lower value can lead to more frequent restarts, which might be beneficial for certain problems.
5. **var-decay**: A lower variable activity decay factor can help the solver focus on more recent activities, potentially improving performance.
6. **lbd-cut** and **lbd-cut-max**: These parameters control the aggressiveness of clause deletion based on LBD values. Adjusting these can help balance memory usage and solving speed.
7. **cla-decay**: Similar to `var-decay`, a lower clause activity decay factor can help the solver focus on more recent clauses.
8. **rnd-freq**: Increasing the frequency of random variable selection can help the solver explore different parts of the search space.
9. **phase-saving**: This parameter controls how the solver saves phases of variables, which can affect the solver's ability to find solutions quickly.
10. **ccmin-mode**: The conflict clause minimization mode can significantly impact the solver's efficiency by reducing the size of learned clauses.
11. **rfirst**: The initial number of conflicts before the first restart can affect the solver's early behavior.
12. **cp-increase**: The increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help manage memory usage and solver performance.
13. **pre**: Preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance.
14. **elim**: Variable elimination can simplify the problem, potentially reducing runtime.
15. **simp-gc-frac**: The garbage collection fraction during simplification can help manage memory usage during the simplification process.

### Suggested Adjustments

Based on the analysis, here are the suggested adjustments to optimize the configuration:

1. **luby**: Set to `0.1` to enable a moderate Luby restart strategy.
2. **rnd-init**: Set to `True` to randomly initialize variable assignments.
3. **gc-frac**: Increase to `0.3` to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.
4. **rinc**: Decrease to `1.5` to allow more frequent restarts.
5. **var-decay**: Decrease to `0.7` to focus on more recent activities.
6. **lbd-cut**: Decrease to `4.0` to be more aggressive in clause deletion.
7. **lbd-cut-max**: Decrease to `8.0` to balance memory usage and performance.
8. **cla-decay**: Decrease to `0.99` to focus on more recent clauses.
9. **rnd-freq**: Increase to `0.1` to explore more of the search space.
10. **phase-saving**: Set to `1` to save fewer phases, potentially improving performance.
11. **ccmin-mode**: Set to `1` to use a less aggressive conflict clause minimization.
12. **rfirst**: Decrease to `50` to start with a smaller number of conflicts before the first restart.
13. **cp-increase**: Increase to `20,000` to manage memory usage better.
14. **pre**: Keep as `True` to enable preprocessing.
15. **elim**: Keep as `True` to enable variable elimination.
16. **simp-gc-frac**: Increase to `0.7` to manage memory usage during simplification.
