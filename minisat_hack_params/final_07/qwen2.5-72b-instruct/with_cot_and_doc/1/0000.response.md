To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that significantly influence the solver's behavior, such as restart strategies, variable and clause activity management, and simplification techniques. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze Parameters

1. **luby**:
   - **Impact**: Affects the restart strategy. Using Luby can help escape local minima but might increase the number of restarts.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `0.1` to enable a moderate Luby restart strategy.

2. **rnd-init**:
   - **Impact**: Random initialization can help break symmetry and find solutions faster.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `True` to enable random initialization.

3. **gc-frac**:
   - **Impact**: Controls the frequency of garbage collection, which can affect memory usage and performance.
   - **Optimization**: Increase to `0.3` to reduce frequent garbage collection.

4. **rinc**:
   - **Impact**: Determines how quickly the restart interval increases.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `1.5` to balance between frequent and infrequent restarts.

5. **var-decay**:
   - **Impact**: Affects how quickly variable activities decay, influencing the solver's focus on recent variables.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `0.9` to give more weight to recent activities.

6. **lbd-cut** and **lbd-cut-max**:
   - **Impact**: These parameters control the cutoff for learned clauses based on their LBD, affecting memory usage and performance.
   - **Optimization**: Set **lbd-cut** to `4` and **lbd-cut-max** to `8` to balance between keeping useful clauses and managing memory.

7. **cla-decay**:
   - **Impact**: Affects how quickly clause activities decay, similar to var-decay but for clauses.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `0.99` to give more weight to recent clauses.

8. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Impact**: Influences the frequency of random variable selection, which can help explore the search space.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `0.1` to introduce some randomness without overwhelming the solver.

9. **phase-saving**:
   - **Impact**: Controls the phase-saving heuristic, which can help in finding solutions faster.
   - **Optimization**: Set to `1` to use a more aggressive phase-saving strategy.

10. **ccmin-mode**:
    - **Impact**: Determines the level of conflict clause minimization.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `1` to balance between thoroughness and performance.

11. **rfirst**:
    - **Impact**: Controls the initial number of conflicts before the first restart.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `50` to start with a smaller number of conflicts.

12. **cp-increase**:
    - **Impact**: Determines the increase in conflict limit for clause deletion.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `10,000` to balance between frequent and infrequent deletions.

13. **pre**:
    - **Impact**: Enabling preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size.
    - **Optimization**: Keep as `True`.

14. **verb**:
    - **Impact**: Verbosity level affects the amount of output, which can slow down the solver.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `0` to minimize output.

15. **rcheck**:
    - **Impact**: Checking for satisfied clauses during simplification can improve performance.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `True`.

16. **asymm**:
    - **Impact**: Asymmetric branching can help in certain problem instances.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `True`.

17. **elim**:
    - **Impact**: Variable elimination can simplify the problem.
    - **Optimization**: Keep as `True`.

18. **simp-gc-frac**:
    - **Impact**: Controls garbage collection during simplification.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `0.4` to balance between frequent and infrequent garbage collection.

19. **grow**:
    - **Impact**: Controls variable growth in simplification.
    - **Optimization**: Set to `100` to allow some growth.

20. **@sub-lim$flag** and **sub-lim$bounded**:
    - **Impact**: Subsumption limits can affect the solver's efficiency.
    - **Optimization**: Set **@sub-lim$flag** to `False` and **sub-lim$bounded** to `500` to manage subsumption effectively.

21. **@cl-lim$flag** and **cl-lim$bounded**:
    - **Impact**: Clause learning limits can affect the solver's efficiency.
    - **Optimization**: Set **@cl-lim$flag** to `False` and **cl-lim$bounded** to `100` to manage clause learning effectively.
