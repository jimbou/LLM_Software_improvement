Optimizing SAT solver parameters can significantly impact the runtime performance of solving instances. The parameters you've provided seem to be for a SAT solver like Glucose or a similar CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) solver. Here are some suggestions for optimizing these parameters for better runtime efficiency:

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **luby**: `0.0` - This parameter is typically used for clause decay with the Luby sequence. Setting it to `0.0` means no Luby-based decay, which is often a good default. Keep it as is.
2. **rnd-init**: `'False'` - Random initialization can sometimes help but often adds overhead. Keeping it `False` is usually better for performance.
3. **gc-frac**: `0.2` - This controls the garbage collection fraction. A value of `0.2` is reasonable and can be kept as is.
4. **rinc**: `2.0` - The restart increment factor. A value of `2.0` is standard and works well in most cases. Keep it as is.
5. **var-decay**: `0.8` - Variable activity decay. A value of `0.8` is a good starting point. You might want to experiment slightly around this value (e.g., `0.75` or `0.85`) to see if it improves performance.
6. **lbd-cut**: `5.0` - LBD (Literal Block Distance) cut-off for learned clauses. A value of `5.0` is reasonable. You might try reducing it to `4.0` or increasing it to `6.0` to see if it helps.
7. **lbd-cut-max**: `10.0` - Maximum LBD cut-off. A value of `10.0` is a good balance. You might try increasing it to `12.0` if you have more complex instances.
8. **cla-decay**: `0.999` - Clause activity decay. A value of `0.999` is very common and works well. Keep it as is.
9. **rnd-freq**: `0.0` - Frequency of random decisions. Setting it to `0.0` means no random decisions, which is generally better for performance. Keep it as is.
10. **rnd-seed**: `91648253` - Random seed. This can be left as is unless you have specific reasons to change it.
11. **phase-saving**: `2` - Phase saving level. A value of `2` is a good default. You might try setting it to `1` if you find it beneficial.
12. **ccmin-mode**: `2` - Conflict clause minimization mode. A value of `2` is a good default. You might try setting it to `1` if you find it beneficial.
13. **rfirst**: `100` - First restart limit. A value of `100` is a good starting point. You might try increasing it to `200` if you have larger instances.
14. **cp-increase**: `15000` - Clause per increase. A value of `15000` is a good default. You might try increasing it to `20000` if you have more complex instances.
15. **pre**: `'True'` - Preprocessing. Enabling preprocessing (`True`) is generally beneficial. Keep it as is.
16. **verb**: `'1'` - Verbosity level. A value of `1` is a good default. You might set it to `0` if you don't need detailed output.
17. **rcheck**: `'False'` - Restart check. Disabling it (`False`) is generally better for performance. Keep it as is.
18. **asymm**: `'False'` - Asymmetric branching. Disabling it (`False`) is generally better for performance. Keep it as is.
19. **elim**: `'True'` - Variable elimination. Enabling it (`True`) is generally beneficial. Keep it as is.
20. **simp-gc-frac**: `0.5` - Simplification garbage collection fraction. A value of `0.5` is a good default. You might try reducing it to `0.4` if you find it beneficial.
21. **@sub-lim$flag**: `'False'` - Subsumption limit flag. Disabling it (`False`) is generally better for performance. Keep it as is.
22. **@cl-lim$flag**: `'False'` - Clause limit flag. Disabling it (`False`) is generally better for performance. Keep it as is.
23. **grow**: `0` - Growth factor. A value of `0` means no growth, which is a good default. Keep it as is.

### Summary of Changes:

- **lbd-cut**: Try `4.0` or `6.0`.
- **lbd-cut-max**: Try `12.0`.
- **phase-saving**: Try `1`.
- **ccmin-mode**: Try `1`.
- **rfirst**: Try `200`.
- **cp-increase**: Try `20000`.
- **verb**: Try `0`.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance of your SAT solver. However, the optimal settings can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the instances you are solving, so it's always a good idea to experiment with different values and measure the performance.
