To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their descriptions and constraints. Here are the optimized parameters:

```plaintext
luby := 0.1
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 6.0
lbd-cut-max := 12.0
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '0'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.6
grow := 0
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **luby := 0.1**
   - **Reason**: A non-zero value for `luby` can help with the restart strategy, potentially improving performance by periodically restarting the solver to escape local minima.

2. **gc-frac := 0.3**
   - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection threshold can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can be costly in terms of performance.

3. **rinc := 1.5**
   - **Reason**: Reducing the restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more effectively.

4. **var-decay := 0.9**
   - **Reason**: Increasing the variable activity decay factor can help maintain a more balanced focus on both new and old variables, potentially leading to better performance.

5. **lbd-cut := 6.0**
   - **Reason**: Slightly increasing the LBD cutoff value can help filter out less useful clauses, reducing the search space and improving performance.

6. **lbd-cut-max := 12.0**
   - **Reason**: Increasing the maximum LBD cutoff value can further help in filtering out less useful clauses, but not too much to avoid losing important information.

7. **rfirst := 50**
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of conflicts before the first restart can help the solver start exploring the search space more quickly.

8. **cp-increase := 10000**
   - **Reason**: Reducing the increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help manage memory usage more efficiently, potentially improving performance.

9. **verb := '0'**
   - **Reason**: Setting the verbosity level to 0 can reduce the overhead of logging and output, which can improve runtime performance.

10. **simp-gc-frac := 0.6**
    - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction during simplification can help manage memory more effectively, reducing the risk of memory-related slowdowns.

### Summary:
These changes aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency. The adjustments should help improve the runtime performance of the solver while maintaining its ability to solve the problem effectively.
