To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can adjust several parameters based on their descriptions and typical best practices. Here are the optimized parameters:

```plaintext
luby := 0.0
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 5.0
lbd-cut-max := 10.0
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
grow := 0
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **gc-frac**:
   - Increased from `0.2` to `0.3`. A slightly higher garbage collection threshold can help reduce the overhead of frequent garbage collection, potentially improving performance.

2. **rinc**:
   - Decreased from `2.0` to `1.5`. A lower restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster.

3. **var-decay**:
   - Increased from `0.8` to `0.9`. A higher variable activity decay factor can help maintain a more balanced exploration of the search space, reducing the risk of getting stuck in unproductive areas.

4. **rfirst**:
   - Decreased from `100` to `50`. Reducing the number of conflicts before the first restart can help the solver start exploring different parts of the search space earlier, which can be beneficial for certain problem instances.

5. **cp-increase**:
   - Decreased from `15000` to `10000`. A lower increase in the conflict limit for clause deletion can help manage memory usage more effectively, especially for problems with a large number of clauses.

### Additional Considerations:

- **rnd-init** and **rnd-freq**:
  - These parameters are set to their default values (`False` and `0.0` respectively), as introducing randomness can sometimes degrade performance if not carefully tuned. However, if you observe that the solver gets stuck in certain patterns, you might consider enabling these parameters with small values to introduce some randomness.

- **pre**:
  - Preprocessing is enabled (`True`), which is generally beneficial for performance as it can simplify the problem before solving.

- **elim**:
  - Variable elimination is enabled (`True`), which can help reduce the problem size and improve performance.

- **rcheck** and **asymm**:
  - These are disabled (`False`), as they can add overhead without necessarily providing significant benefits for all problem types.

- **@sub-lim$flag** and **@cl-lim$flag**:
  - These hidden parameters are left at their default values (`False`), indicating that no specific limits are applied for subsumption or clause learning. This allows the solver to use its default strategies, which are often well-tuned for general performance.

By making these adjustments, the solver should perform more efficiently while still maintaining the necessary functionality to solve the given problems.
