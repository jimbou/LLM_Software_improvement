To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the impact of each parameter on the solver's efficiency. Here are some key adjustments and explanations:

### Optimized Parameters:

```plaintext
luby := 0.1
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 6.0
lbd-cut-max := 15.0
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.05
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.7
grow := 0
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **luby := 0.1**
   - **Reason**: A slightly higher value for `luby` can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to faster convergence for certain problem instances.

2. **gc-frac := 0.3**
   - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively, reducing the overhead of frequent garbage collection.

3. **rinc := 1.5**
   - **Reason**: Reducing the restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster.

4. **var-decay := 0.9**
   - **Reason**: A higher variable activity decay factor can help in maintaining a more balanced activity score, preventing the solver from getting stuck on a few variables.

5. **lbd-cut := 6.0**
   - **Reason**: Increasing the LBD cutoff value can help in reducing the number of learned clauses, which can improve performance by reducing memory usage and processing time.

6. **lbd-cut-max := 15.0**
   - **Reason**: Similarly, increasing the maximum LBD cutoff value can further reduce the number of learned clauses, but not too much to lose important information.

7. **cla-decay := 0.99**
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause activity decay factor can help in maintaining the relevance of clauses over time, which can be beneficial for longer-running problems.

8. **rnd-freq := 0.05**
   - **Reason**: Introducing a small frequency of random variable selection can help in diversifying the search and potentially finding solutions faster.

9. **rfirst := 50**
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of conflicts before the first restart can help in more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial for certain problem types.

10. **cp-increase := 10000**
    - **Reason**: Reducing the increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help in more aggressive clause deletion, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

11. **simp-gc-frac := 0.7**
    - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction during simplification can help manage memory more effectively, reducing the overhead of frequent garbage collection.

### Additional Considerations:

- **pre := 'True'**
  - **Reason**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial as it can simplify the problem and reduce the search space.

- **verb := '1'**
  - **Reason**: Keeping the verbosity level at 1 provides a balance between detailed output and minimal overhead.

- **rcheck := 'False'**
  - **Reason**: Disabling the check for satisfied clauses during simplification can reduce overhead, especially if the problem is large.

- **asymm := 'False'**
  - **Reason**: Asymmetric branching is generally not necessary unless the problem has specific characteristics that benefit from it.

- **elim := 'True'**
  - **Reason**: Variable elimination can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance.

- **grow := 0**
  - **Reason**: Keeping this at 0 ensures that the solver does not unnecessarily grow the problem during simplification.

- **@sub-lim$flag := 'False'**
  - **Reason**: Using the bounded subsumption limit (`sub-lim$bounded`) is generally safer and more efficient for most problems.

- **@cl-lim$flag := 'False'**
  - **Reason**: Using the bounded clause learning limit (`cl-lim$bounded`) helps in managing memory and processing time effectively.

By making these adjustments, the solver should exhibit improved runtime performance while maintaining its ability to solve the given problem effectively.
