To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make adjustments based on the provided documentation and typical best practices for SAT solvers. Here are the optimized parameters:

```plaintext
luby := 0.1
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
lbd-cut := 5.0
lbd-cut-max := 10.0
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
cp-increase := 10000
pre := 'True'
verb := '0'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
grow := 0
@sub-lim$flag := 'False'
@cl-lim$flag := 'False'
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **luby**:
   - **Original**: `0.0`
   - **Optimized**: `0.1`
   - **Reason**: A small non-zero value for `luby` can help in breaking symmetry and improving convergence, especially in complex problems.

2. **gc-frac**:
   - **Original**: `0.2`
   - **Optimized**: `0.3`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can reduce the overhead of frequent garbage collection, which can improve performance.

3. **rinc**:
   - **Original**: `2.0`
   - **Optimized**: `1.5`
   - **Reason**: A lower restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and potentially speed up solving time.

4. **var-decay**:
   - **Original**: `0.8`
   - **Optimized**: `0.9`
   - **Reason**: A higher variable activity decay factor can help in maintaining a more stable and accurate activity score, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on relevant variables.

5. **cp-increase**:
   - **Original**: `15000`
   - **Optimized**: `10000`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help in managing memory usage and reducing the overhead of clause management.

6. **verb**:
   - **Original**: `1`
   - **Optimized**: `0`
   - **Reason**: Setting verbosity to `0` reduces the amount of output, which can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

### Other Parameters:
- **rnd-init**, **rnd-freq**, **rnd-seed**, **phase-saving**, **ccmin-mode**, **rfirst**, **pre**, **rcheck**, **asymm**, **elim**, **simp-gc-frac**, **grow**, **@sub-lim$flag**, and **@cl-lim$flag** remain unchanged as they are already set to reasonable values or are not critical for performance tuning.

These changes aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency, leading to improved runtime performance while maintaining the solver's functionality.
