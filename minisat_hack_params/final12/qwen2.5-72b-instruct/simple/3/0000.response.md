These adjustments aim to balance the solver's performance by reducing the garbage collection frequency (`gc-frac`), increasing the restart increment (`rinc`), adjusting variable decay rate (`var-decay`), and tweaking other parameters that can affect the solver's speed without significantly impacting its effectiveness. The verbosity is also reduced (`verb := '0'`) to minimize output overhead.
