### Explanation of Changes:
1. **gc-frac (0.2 -> 0.15)**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can decrease the overhead of garbage collection, potentially leading to faster runtimes, especially in scenarios with frequent clause learning and deletion.

2. **rinc (2.0 -> 1.5)**: A smaller restart increment can help the solver explore more diverse parts of the search space, which can be beneficial for harder instances. This adjustment balances exploration and exploitation.

3. **var-decay (0.8 -> 0.95)**: Increasing the variable decay rate slows down the decay of variable activity scores, which can lead to better focus on relevant variables and potentially faster convergence to a solution.

4. **cla-decay (0.999 -> 0.99)**: Slightly reducing the clause decay rate helps in maintaining more learned clauses, which can improve the solver's ability to prune the search space effectively.

5. **rnd-freq (0.0 -> 0.02)**: Introducing a small random frequency can help escape local minima and improve the robustness of the solver, especially for problems where the initial search space is highly constrained.

6. **rfirst (100 -> 50)**: Reducing the first restart interval can help the solver start exploring different parts of the search space earlier, which can be beneficial for finding solutions faster.

7. **cp-increase (15000 -> 10000)**: Decreasing the conflict point increase threshold can help the solver manage memory more efficiently, reducing the risk of running out of memory and improving overall performance.

8. **simp-gc-frac (0.5 -> 0.4)**: Lowering the simplification garbage collection fraction can reduce the overhead associated with frequent garbage collection during simplification, leading to faster runtimes.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency, which should collectively improve the runtime performance of the solver.
