### Explanation of Changes and Impact on Runtime Performance:

1. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction) from 0.2 to 0.5:**
   - **Impact:** Increasing this value means that garbage collection will be triggered more frequently, which can help in managing memory more efficiently and potentially reduce the risk of running out of memory. However, it also means that the solver will spend more time on garbage collection. The value of 0.5 strikes a balance between frequent and infrequent garbage collection, optimizing for both memory usage and runtime performance.

2. **var-decay (Variable Decay Rate) from 0.8 to 0.95:**
   - **Impact:** A higher variable decay rate means that the solver will place less emphasis on older learned clauses, which can help in reducing the overhead of maintaining a large number of clauses. This can lead to faster decision-making and potentially better performance, especially in problems where the solution space is highly dynamic.

3. **lbd-cut (Literal Block Distance Cut-off) from 5.0 to 7.0:**
   - **Impact:** Increasing this value allows the solver to keep more learned clauses with a higher LBD, which can be beneficial in problems with complex dependencies. This can improve the solver's ability to learn and use more relevant information, potentially leading to faster convergence to a solution.

4. **lbd-cut-max (Maximum Literal Block Distance Cut-off) from 10.0 to 12.0:**
   - **Impact:** Similarly to `lbd-cut`, increasing this value allows the solver to retain even more learned clauses, which can be useful in problems where deeper exploration is needed. This change complements the increase in `lbd-cut` and can further enhance the solver's learning capabilities.

5. **cla-decay (Clause Decay Rate) from 0.999 to 0.99:**
   - **Impact:** Reducing the clause decay rate slightly means that the solver will keep clauses longer before they are considered for removal. This can help in maintaining a more stable set of learned clauses, which can be beneficial in solving complex problems. However, it also increases the memory footprint, so the trade-off is carefully balanced with the other parameters.

6. **cp-increase (Conflict Point Increase) from 15000 to 20000:**
   - **Impact:** Increasing this value means that the solver will attempt to find more conflict points before triggering certain optimizations. This can lead to more efficient conflict analysis and potentially better performance, especially in problems with a high number of conflicts.

7. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction) from 0.5 to 0.75:**
   - **Impact:** Increasing this value means that garbage collection during simplification will be triggered more frequently, which can help in maintaining a cleaner state during the simplification process. This can lead to more efficient simplification and potentially faster overall performance.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between memory management, clause learning, and conflict resolution, all of which are critical factors in the performance of a SAT solver.
