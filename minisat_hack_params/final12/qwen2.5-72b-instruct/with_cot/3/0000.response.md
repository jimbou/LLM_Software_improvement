### Explanation of Changes:

1. **`gc-frac`**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1. This parameter controls the garbage collection fraction for learned clauses. A lower value can reduce the overhead of clause deletion, potentially improving runtime performance by keeping more relevant clauses.

2. **`rinc`**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. This parameter controls the rate at which the restart interval increases. A smaller value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and improve overall search efficiency.

3. **`var-decay`**: Increased from 0.8 to 0.95. This parameter controls the decay rate for variable activity. A higher value can make the solver less aggressive in forgetting past activity, which can help maintain a better focus on important variables.

4. **`lbd-cut`**: Increased from 5.0 to 7.0. This parameter sets the minimum LBD (Learned Binary Decisions) cut-off for learned clauses. A higher value can help reduce the number of less useful clauses, potentially improving performance.

5. **`lbd-cut-max`**: Increased from 10.0 to 15.0. This parameter sets the maximum LBD cut-off for learned clauses. A higher value allows for more flexibility in clause learning, which can be beneficial for complex problems.

6. **`cla-decay`**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.99. This parameter controls the decay rate for clause activity. A slightly lower value can help the solver forget less useful clauses more quickly, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

7. **`rnd-freq`**: Increased from 0.0 to 0.02. This parameter controls the frequency of random decisions. A small non-zero value can introduce some randomness into the decision-making process, which can help avoid getting stuck in poor local optima.

8. **`rfirst`**: Reduced from 100 to 50. This parameter sets the initial restart interval. A smaller value can lead to more frequent restarts early in the solving process, which can help the solver explore the search space more effectively.

9. **`cp-increase`**: Reduced from 15000 to 10000. This parameter controls the increase in the conflict clause limit. A smaller value can reduce the number of conflict clauses retained, which can help manage memory usage and improve performance.

10. **`simp-gc-frac`**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4. This parameter controls the garbage collection fraction during simplification. A lower value can reduce the overhead of simplification, potentially improving performance.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency, leading to improved runtime performance.
