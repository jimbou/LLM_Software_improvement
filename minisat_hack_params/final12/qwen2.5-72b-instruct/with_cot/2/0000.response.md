### Explanation of Changes:
1. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction) from 0.2 to 0.1:**
   - Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help reduce overhead and improve runtime performance, especially in scenarios where frequent garbage collection is not necessary.

2. **rinc (Restart Increment) from 2.0 to 1.5:**
   - A lower restart increment can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more efficiently, potentially leading to faster convergence.

3. **var-decay (Variable Decay) from 0.8 to 0.95:**
   - Increasing the variable decay rate can help maintain a more balanced activity score for variables, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on relevant variables and reduce redundant work.

4. **lbd-cut (Literal Block Distance Cut) from 5.0 to 4.0:**
   - Lowering the LBD cut can help the solver discard less useful clauses earlier, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

5. **lbd-cut-max (Maximum Literal Block Distance Cut) from 10.0 to 9.0:**
   - Similarly, reducing the maximum LBD cut can further optimize clause management and reduce the overhead of maintaining large clauses.

6. **cla-decay (Clause Decay) from 0.999 to 0.998:**
   - A slightly more aggressive clause decay can help keep the clause database more manageable, which can improve runtime performance.

7. **rnd-freq (Random Frequency) from 0.0 to 0.05:**
   - Introducing a small random frequency can help the solver escape local optima and explore the search space more thoroughly, potentially leading to better solutions.

8. **rfirst (First Restart) from 100 to 50:**
   - A lower first restart value can help the solver start the restart process earlier, which can be beneficial for problems that require early exploration.

9. **cp-increase (Conflict Points Increase) from 15000 to 10000:**
   - Reducing the conflict points increase can help the solver manage conflicts more efficiently, potentially leading to faster resolution times.

10. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction) from 0.5 to 0.4:**
    - Lowering the simplification garbage collection fraction can help reduce the overhead associated with garbage collection during the simplification phase, improving overall performance.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency, ultimately leading to improved runtime performance.
