### Explanation of Changes:

1. **gc-frac (0.2 -> 0.1)**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can decrease the overhead of frequent garbage collection, potentially improving runtime performance.

2. **rinc (2.0 -> 1.5)**: Decreasing the restart increment can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and improve the solver's ability to find solutions faster.

3. **var-decay (0.8 -> 0.9)**: Increasing the variable decay rate can help maintain a more balanced exploration of the search space, reducing the risk of getting stuck in unproductive areas.

4. **lbd-cut (5.0 -> 7.0) and lbd-cut-max (10.0 -> 12.0)**: Adjusting these parameters can help in better managing the length of learned clauses, potentially leading to more efficient memory usage and faster solving times.

5. **cla-decay (0.999 -> 0.995)**: Slightly increasing the clause decay rate can help in discarding less useful clauses more quickly, reducing the solver's memory footprint and improving performance.

6. **rnd-freq (0.0 -> 0.02)**: Introducing a small random frequency can add some randomness to the decision-making process, helping to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima.

7. **rfirst (100 -> 50)**: Reducing the initial restart interval can speed up the initial solving phase, allowing the solver to explore more potential solutions early on.

8. **cp-increase (15000 -> 10000)**: Lowering the conflict point increase can make the solver more responsive to changes in the problem, potentially leading to faster convergence.

9. **simp-gc-frac (0.5 -> 0.3)**: Reducing the simplification garbage collection fraction can decrease the frequency of expensive garbage collection operations during simplification, improving performance.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce unnecessary overhead, and optimize the solver's behavior for better runtime performance.
