### Explanation:
1. **gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can be expensive.
2. **rinc**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to decrease the restart interval, potentially leading to more frequent and effective restarts.
3. **var-decay**: Increased from 0.8 to 0.9 to slow down the decay of variable activities, which can help in maintaining a more stable search space.
4. **lbd-cut**: Reduced from 5.0 to 4.0 to lower the cutoff for LBD, which can help in identifying more useful clauses.
5. **lbd-cut-max**: Reduced from 10.0 to 8.0 to set a slightly lower upper bound for LBD, balancing between clause usefulness and memory usage.
6. **rfirst**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to initiate the first restart earlier, which can help in breaking out of local minima faster.
7. **cp-increase**: Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to decrease the conflict limit increase, potentially reducing the overhead of clause deletion.
8. **simp-gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 to perform more frequent but less extensive garbage collection during simplification, which can help in maintaining a cleaner data structure without significant performance loss.

These adjustments aim to optimize the solver's performance while maintaining its functionality.
