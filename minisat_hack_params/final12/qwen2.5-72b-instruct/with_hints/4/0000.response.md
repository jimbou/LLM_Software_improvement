### Explanation:
1. **`gc-frac`**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to decrease the frequency of garbage collection, which can improve performance.
2. **`rinc`**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to make the restart strategy less aggressive, potentially leading to better search space exploration.
3. **`var-decay`**: Increased from 0.8 to 0.95 to slow down the decay of variable activity, which can help in maintaining a more stable search process.
4. **`lbd-cut`**: Reduced from 5.0 to 3.0 to cut off lower-quality learned clauses more aggressively, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
5. **`lbd-cut-max`**: Reduced from 10.0 to 8.0 for similar reasons as `lbd-cut`.
6. **`rfirst`**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to start the first restart earlier, which can help in finding solutions faster.
7. **`cp-increase`**: Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to reduce the threshold for clause pruning, which can help in managing memory and improving performance.
8. **`simp-gc-frac`**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4 to perform simpler garbage collection more frequently, which can help in maintaining a cleaner state and potentially improving performance.

These changes aim to balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce unnecessary overhead, and optimize the solver's performance while maintaining its functionality.
