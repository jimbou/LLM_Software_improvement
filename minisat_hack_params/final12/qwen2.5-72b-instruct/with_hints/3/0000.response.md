### Explanation:
1. **`gc-frac := 0.1`**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help reduce overhead and improve runtime performance.
2. **`rinc := 1.5`**: Lowering the restart increment can help the solver converge faster by restarting more frequently.
3. **`var-decay := 0.9`**: Increasing the variable decay factor slightly can help maintain a better balance between exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to faster solving times.
4. **`rfirst := 50`**: Reducing the first restart value can help the solver start the search process more quickly.
5. **`cp-increase := 10000`**: Lowering the clause learning increase threshold can help manage memory usage and reduce the overhead of clause learning.

These changes aim to strike a balance between reducing runtime and maintaining the effectiveness of the solver.
