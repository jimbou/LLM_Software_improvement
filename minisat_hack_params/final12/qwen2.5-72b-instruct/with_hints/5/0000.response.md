### Explanation:
1. **`gc-frac`**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to reduce garbage collection overhead and improve runtime performance.
2. **`rinc`**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to decrease the rate at which the restart interval increases, potentially leading to more frequent but shorter restarts.
3. **`var-decay`**: Increased from 0.8 to 0.9 to slow down the decay of variable activities, which can help in finding solutions faster by maintaining more information about variable importance.
4. **`lbd-cut`**: Reduced from 5.0 to 4.0 to cut off learned clauses earlier, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
5. **`lbd-cut-max`**: Reduced from 10.0 to 8.0 for similar reasons as `lbd-cut`.
6. **`cla-decay`**: Reduced from 0.999 to 0.99 to slightly increase the decay rate of clause activities, which can help in managing memory more efficiently.
7. **`rfirst`**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to start with a smaller initial restart interval, which can lead to quicker early convergence.
8. **`cp-increase`**: Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to decrease the threshold for increasing the conflict limit, which can help in managing the solver's state more effectively.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-offs between memory usage, computational overhead, and the speed of finding solutions.
