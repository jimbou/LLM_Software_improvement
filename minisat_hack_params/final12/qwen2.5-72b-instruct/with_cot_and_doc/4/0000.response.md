### Explanation of Changes:

1. **gc-frac**: Increased from `0.2` to `0.3`. A higher garbage collection fraction can help reduce the memory overhead by cleaning up more frequently, which can be beneficial for problems with high memory usage.

2. **rinc**: Increased from `2.0` to `2.5`. A higher restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster.

3. **var-decay**: Increased from `0.8` to `0.9`. A higher variable activity decay factor means variables will lose their activity more slowly, which can help in focusing on the most relevant variables over time.

4. **lbd-cut**: Increased from `5.0` to `6.0`. A higher LBD cutoff value can help in pruning less useful learned clauses, which can reduce the size of the clause database and improve performance.

5. **lbd-cut-max**: Increased from `10.0` to `12.0`. Similarly, increasing the maximum LBD cutoff value can further aid in reducing the number of less useful clauses, improving performance.

6. **cla-decay**: Slightly increased from `0.999` to `0.99`. A slightly lower clause activity decay factor can help in maintaining a more dynamic clause database, which can be beneficial for solving complex problems.

7. **rfirst**: Increased from `100` to `200`. A higher initial number of conflicts before the first restart can help in exploring the search space more thoroughly before restarting, potentially leading to better solutions.

8. **cp-increase**: Increased from `15000` to `20000`. A higher increase in conflict limit for clause deletion can help in managing the clause database more effectively, ensuring that useful clauses are retained longer.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and clause database maintenance, which can collectively lead to improved runtime performance.
