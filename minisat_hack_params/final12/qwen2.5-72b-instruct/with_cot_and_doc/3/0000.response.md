### Explanation of Changes:

1. **luby**:
   - **Change from 0.0 to 0.1**: A small non-zero value can help break long cycles in the search space, potentially leading to faster convergence.

2. **gc-frac**:
   - **Change from 0.2 to 0.3**: Increasing this value can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which might improve performance by reducing overhead.

3. **rinc**:
   - **Change from 2.0 to 1.5**: A smaller restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima more effectively.

4. **var-decay**:
   - **Change from 0.8 to 0.9**: A higher variable decay factor means that variable activities decay more slowly, which can help maintain a more stable search direction.

5. **lbd-cut**:
   - **Change from 5.0 to 6.0**: A higher LBD cutoff can help filter out less useful learned clauses, potentially improving performance by reducing memory usage.

6. **lbd-cut-max**:
   - **Change from 10.0 to 12.0**: Increasing the maximum LBD cutoff can further help in managing the quality of learned clauses, potentially leading to better performance.

7. **cla-decay**:
   - **Change from 0.999 to 0.995**: A slightly lower clause decay factor can help reduce the weight of older clauses more quickly, which can be beneficial in dynamic search spaces.

8. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Change from 0.0 to 0.05**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help explore different parts of the search space, potentially avoiding getting stuck in local optima.

9. **rfirst**:
   - **Change from 100 to 200**: Increasing the number of conflicts before the first restart can help the solver gather more information before restarting, potentially leading to better decisions.

10. **cp-increase**:
    - **Change from 15000 to 20000**: A higher increase in the conflict limit for clause deletion can help manage the growth of the clause database more effectively, potentially improving performance.

11. **simp-gc-frac**:
    - **Change from 0.5 to 0.6**: A higher garbage collection fraction during simplification can help keep the memory usage in check, potentially improving overall performance.

These changes are designed to balance exploration and exploitation, manage memory usage, and reduce unnecessary overhead, all of which can contribute to improved runtime performance.
