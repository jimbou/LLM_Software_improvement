### Explanation of Changes:
1. **gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can be a costly operation.
2. **rinc**: Decreased from 2.0 to 1.5 to make the restarts more frequent, which can help escape local optima and potentially find solutions faster.
3. **var-decay**: Increased from 0.8 to 0.9 to slow down the decay of variable activities, which can help maintain a more stable search direction.
4. **lbd-cut**: Increased from 5.0 to 6.0 to allow for slightly larger clauses, which might capture more complex patterns in the problem.
5. **lbd-cut-max**: Increased from 10.0 to 12.0 to provide more flexibility in the maximum LBD cutoff.
6. **cla-decay**: Slightly increased from 0.999 to 0.99 to slow down the decay of clause activities, which can help in retaining important clauses longer.
7. **rfirst**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to initiate the first restart earlier, potentially helping in exploring different parts of the search space sooner.
8. **cp-increase**: Reduced from 15000 to 10000 to reduce the increase in the conflict limit for clause deletion, making the solver more aggressive in removing less useful clauses.

These adjustments aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and potentially speed up the solving process.
