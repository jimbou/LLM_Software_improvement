### Explanation of Changes and Impact on Runtime Performance:

1. **gc-frac**:
   - **Change**: Reduced from `0.2` to `0.1`.
   - **Impact**: Reducing the garbage collection threshold can help reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can be a time-consuming process. This should improve overall runtime performance.

2. **rinc**:
   - **Change**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.5`.
   - **Impact**: A lower restart increment factor means that restarts will occur more frequently. Frequent restarts can help escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster, but too frequent restarts can also lead to increased overhead. A balance is needed, and `1.5` is a good compromise.

3. **var-decay**:
   - **Change**: Increased from `0.8` to `0.9`.
   - **Impact**: A higher variable activity decay factor means that variable activities will decrease more slowly, giving more weight to recent activities. This can help in focusing the search on more relevant variables, potentially leading to faster convergence.

4. **rfirst**:
   - **Change**: Reduced from `100` to `50`.
   - **Impact**: Starting with a smaller number of conflicts before the first restart can help the solver quickly adapt to the problem structure and potentially find a solution faster.

5. **cp-increase**:
   - **Change**: Reduced from `15000` to `10000`.
   - **Impact**: A smaller increase in the conflict limit for clause deletion means that the solver will delete clauses more frequently. This can help keep the clause database manageable and reduce memory usage, which can improve performance.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reducing unnecessary overhead while maintaining the solver's ability to efficiently search for solutions.
