To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make several adjustments based on the provided documentation and typical trade-offs between performance and accuracy. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **search_steps**: 300
- **restarts**: 5
- **repeats**: 3
- **noise**: 0.1
- **static_noise**: None
- **lowmemory**: True

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300. This reduces the total number of search steps, which can significantly decrease runtime. Since the algorithm will still perform a substantial number of steps, it should maintain a reasonable level of accuracy.

2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Fewer restarts mean fewer complete iterations of the search process, which can speed up the overall runtime. However, this might slightly reduce the robustness of the solution, but it's a trade-off that often works well in practice.

3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Reducing the number of repeats also decreases the total computational load, as each repeat involves running the entire search process again. This change balances performance with the need for multiple runs to ensure reliability.

4. **noise**: Kept at 0.1. The noise level is kept the same to maintain the level of randomness and exploration in the search process, which is important for finding good solutions.

5. **static_noise**: Kept as `None`. Static noise is not enabled, as it can sometimes limit the adaptability of the search process. Keeping it dynamic allows the algorithm to adjust the noise level as needed.

6. **lowmemory**: Set to `True`. Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory consumption, which can be particularly beneficial if the system has limited resources. This setting does not typically affect the runtime performance negatively but helps in managing system resources more efficiently.

By making these adjustments, the runtime performance should improve without significantly compromising the quality of the results.
