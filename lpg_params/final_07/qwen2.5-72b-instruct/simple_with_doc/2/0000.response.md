To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to balance the trade-off between thoroughness and efficiency. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided parameters and their descriptions:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Rationale:
1. **search_steps**:
   - **Original**: 500
   - **Optimized**: 300
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease the runtime. Since the default range is from 100 to 1,000, 300 is a reasonable compromise that maintains a good balance between thoroughness and speed.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Original**: 9
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of restarts can also help in reducing the overall runtime. With 5 restarts, the algorithm still has multiple chances to find a good solution, but it runs faster.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Original**: 5
   - **Optimized**: 3
   - **Reason**: Decreasing the number of repeats reduces the total number of iterations, which can significantly improve runtime performance. Three repeats should still provide a reasonable level of robustness.

4. **noise**:
   - **Original**: 0.1
   - **Optimized**: 0.1
   - **Reason**: The noise level is kept the same as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Changing this might affect the quality of the results.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: None
   - **Reason**: Keeping this parameter as `None` means the noise level can vary dynamically, which is generally more flexible and adaptive to different scenarios.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: True
   - **Reason**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory consumption, which can be beneficial for systems with limited resources. This does not affect the number of search steps, restarts, or repeats but helps in managing resources more efficiently.

By making these adjustments, the algorithm should run faster while still maintaining a reasonable level of functionality and solution quality.
