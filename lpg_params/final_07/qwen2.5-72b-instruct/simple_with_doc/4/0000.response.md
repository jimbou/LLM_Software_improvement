To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality, we can make the following adjustments:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Rationale:
1. **search_steps**:
   - **Original**: 500
   - **Optimized**: 300
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease the runtime. Since the default range is from 100 to 1,000, reducing it to 300 should still provide a reasonable number of steps for the algorithm to converge, but with improved performance.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Original**: 9
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Reason**: Decreasing the number of restarts reduces the overall computational load. The default range is from 1 to 20, so setting it to 5 maintains a balance between thoroughness and performance.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Original**: 5
   - **Optimized**: 3
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of repeats also helps in speeding up the process. The default range is from 1 to 20, and setting it to 3 ensures that the algorithm is still run multiple times for robustness, but with reduced overhead.

4. **noise**:
   - **Original**: 0.1
   - **Optimized**: 0.1
   - **Reason**: The noise level is kept the same as it is already at a moderate level. Changing this might affect the exploration-exploitation balance of the algorithm.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: None
   - **Reason**: Keeping this parameter as `None` is appropriate unless there is a specific need to apply static noise, which is not indicated in the problem statement.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: True
   - **Reason**: Enabling low-memory mode (`True`) can help reduce memory consumption, which is beneficial for improving runtime performance, especially on systems with limited memory resources.

By making these adjustments, the algorithm should run more efficiently while still achieving its intended functionality.
