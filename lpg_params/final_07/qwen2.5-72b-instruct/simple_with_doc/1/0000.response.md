To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make several adjustments based on the provided documentation. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **search_steps**:
   - **Original**: 500
   - **Optimized**: 300
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease the runtime. Since the default value is 500, reducing it to 300 still allows for a substantial search while improving performance.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Original**: 9
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Reason**: Decreasing the number of restarts reduces the overall computational load. The default value is 9, so reducing it to 5 maintains a reasonable number of restarts while enhancing performance.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Original**: 5
   - **Optimized**: 3
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of repeats can further improve runtime performance. The default value is 5, so setting it to 3 balances between performance and thoroughness.

4. **noise**:
   - **Original**: 0.1
   - **Optimized**: 0.1
   - **Reason**: The noise level is kept the same as it is already at a moderate level and does not significantly impact performance.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: None
   - **Reason**: Keeping this parameter as `None` ensures that dynamic noise is used, which is generally more flexible and adaptive.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: True
   - **Reason**: Enabling low-memory mode (`lowmemory := True`) can help reduce memory consumption, which is beneficial for performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.

By making these adjustments, the runtime performance should be improved without significantly compromising the functionality of the algorithm.
