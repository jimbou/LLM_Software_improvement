To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make the following adjustments:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Rationale for Each Change:

1. **search_steps**:
   - **Original**: 500
   - **Optimized**: 300
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of search steps from 500 to 300 can significantly decrease the runtime without drastically affecting the quality of the search results, especially if the initial 300 steps are sufficient to find a good solution.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Original**: 9
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 can also help in reducing the overall runtime. This is a trade-off between thoroughness and speed, but it often works well in practice, especially if the search space is not extremely complex.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Original**: 5
   - **Optimized**: 3
   - **Rationale**: Decreasing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can further reduce the runtime. This parameter controls how many times the entire search procedure is repeated, and reducing it can still provide a reasonable level of robustness while saving time.

4. **noise**:
   - **Original**: 0.1
   - **Optimized**: 0.1
   - **Rationale**: The noise level is kept the same as it is already at a moderate level. Changing this might affect the exploration vs. exploitation balance, which could impact the quality of the results.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: None
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this parameter as `None` because introducing static noise might not be necessary and could potentially degrade performance if the problem does not benefit from it.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Original**: None
   - **Optimized**: True
   - **Rationale**: Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory consumption, which is beneficial for runtime performance, especially on systems with limited memory resources.

By making these adjustments, the algorithm should run faster while still providing a functional and effective search process.
