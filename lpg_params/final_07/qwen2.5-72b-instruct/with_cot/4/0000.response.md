To optimize the given configuration parameters for better runtime performance, we need to analyze each parameter and understand its impact on the system. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **search_steps (500)**: This parameter determines the number of steps in the search process. A higher value can lead to more thorough exploration but will increase the runtime.
2. **restarts (9)**: This parameter specifies the number of times the search process is restarted. More restarts can help avoid local minima but also increase the total runtime.
3. **repeats (5)**: This parameter indicates how many times the entire process is repeated. Repeating the process multiple times can improve the robustness of the results but at the cost of increased runtime.
4. **noise (0.1)**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process, which can help escape local optima. However, too much noise can make the search less efficient.
5. **static_noise ('None')**: This parameter, if set, adds a fixed amount of noise. Since it is set to 'None', no static noise is added.
6. **lowmemory ('None')**: This parameter, if set, optimizes memory usage. Since it is set to 'None', no low-memory optimizations are applied.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Lowering the number of search steps can significantly reduce the runtime while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the search space.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Reducing the number of restarts can decrease the overall runtime without significantly impacting the quality of the solution.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Fewer repetitions will speed up the process, but you need to balance this with the need for robust results.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: A slightly lower noise level can help maintain the ability to escape local optima while making the search more efficient.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce the memory footprint, which might indirectly improve runtime performance by reducing memory-related overhead.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

Here is the optimized configuration:

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **search_steps := 300**: Reducing the number of search steps from 500 to 300 can significantly decrease the runtime while still allowing for a substantial exploration of the search space.
2. **restarts := 5**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 can further decrease the runtime without completely sacrificing the ability to avoid local minima.
3. **repeats := 3**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can speed up the process, but it still allows for multiple runs to ensure robust results.
4. **noise := 0.05**: Lowering the noise level from 0.1 to 0.05 can make the search more efficient while still providing some randomness to help escape local optima.
5. **lowmemory := 'True'**: Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory usage, which might improve runtime performance by reducing memory-related overhead.

By implementing these changes, the overall runtime should be reduced while maintaining a reasonable balance between exploration and efficiency.
