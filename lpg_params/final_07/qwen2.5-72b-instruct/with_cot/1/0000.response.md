To optimize the given configuration parameters for better runtime performance, we need to carefully analyze each parameter and understand its impact on the overall performance. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **search_steps (500)**:
   - This parameter controls the number of steps in the search process. A higher value can lead to more thorough exploration but increases runtime.
   - **Impact**: Directly affects the computational load and runtime.

2. **restarts (9)**:
   - This parameter determines the number of times the search process is restarted. More restarts can help escape local optima but increase total runtime.
   - **Impact**: Increases the total number of iterations, thus increasing runtime.

3. **repeats (5)**:
   - This parameter specifies how many times the entire process (including restarts) is repeated. More repeats can improve robustness but at the cost of increased runtime.
   - **Impact**: Multiplies the total number of iterations, significantly affecting runtime.

4. **noise (0.1)**:
   - This parameter introduces randomness to the search process. It can help explore the solution space more thoroughly but may also introduce unnecessary complexity.
   - **Impact**: Can affect the convergence rate and stability of the search.

5. **static_noise ('None')**:
   - This parameter indicates whether static noise is applied. If set to 'None', no static noise is used.
   - **Impact**: Minimal impact on runtime unless static noise is enabled, which could add additional overhead.

6. **lowmemory ('None')**:
   - This parameter indicates whether a low-memory mode is used. If set to 'None', the default memory usage is applied.
   - **Impact**: Setting this to 'True' can reduce memory usage, potentially improving performance on systems with limited resources.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**:
   - Decrease from 500 to 300. This reduces the number of steps per search, which can significantly decrease runtime while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the solution space.

2. **Reduce `restarts`**:
   - Decrease from 9 to 5. This reduces the number of restarts, which can significantly decrease the total number of iterations and thus the runtime.

3. **Reduce `repeats`**:
   - Decrease from 5 to 3. This further reduces the total number of iterations, balancing robustness with performance.

4. **Adjust `noise`**:
   - Keep `noise` at 0.1, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. However, if further performance gains are needed, consider reducing it slightly to 0.05.

5. **Enable `lowmemory`**:
   - Set `lowmemory` to 'True'. This can help reduce memory usage, which can be beneficial on systems with limited resources and may indirectly improve runtime performance.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reducing `search_steps` from 500 to 300**: This change reduces the computational load per search, leading to a significant decrease in runtime. The reduction is balanced to maintain a reasonable level of exploration.
- **Reducing `restarts` from 9 to 5**: Fewer restarts mean fewer iterations, which directly reduces the total runtime. This change helps in achieving a faster convergence without significantly compromising the quality of the solution.
- **Reducing `repeats` from 5 to 3**: Fewer repetitions mean the entire process is run fewer times, further reducing the total runtime. This change balances the trade-off between robustness and performance.
- **Keeping `noise` at 0.1**: This maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation. If further performance gains are needed, a slight reduction to 0.05 can be considered.
- **Enabling `lowmemory`**: Setting `lowmemory` to 'True' can help reduce memory usage, which can be beneficial on systems with limited resources and may indirectly improve runtime performance.

These adjustments should result in a more efficient and faster-running configuration while maintaining a reasonable level of solution quality.
