To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, we need to consider the impact each parameter has on the overall execution time and resource utilization. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **search_steps**: This parameter controls the number of iterations in the search process. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but will increase the runtime.
2. **restarts**: This parameter specifies the number of times the search process is restarted. More restarts can help escape local optima but also increase the total runtime.
3. **repeats**: This parameter indicates how many times the entire process (including all restarts) is repeated. More repeats can improve robustness but at the cost of increased runtime.
4. **noise**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process, which can help explore the solution space more thoroughly but may also slow down convergence.
5. **static_noise**: This parameter, if set, adds a fixed level of noise. The current setting of 'None' means no static noise is added.
6. **lowmemory**: This parameter, if set, optimizes memory usage. The current setting of 'None' means no low-memory optimizations are applied.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: If the current value of 500 is too high and causing long runtimes, reducing it to a lower value (e.g., 300) might still provide good results while significantly reducing runtime.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 can decrease the total number of iterations, thereby reducing runtime.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can further decrease the total runtime.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: If the noise level of 0.1 is necessary for exploration, consider slightly reducing it to 0.05 to balance exploration and convergence speed.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Setting `lowmemory` to 'True' can help reduce memory usage, which might indirectly improve runtime performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Reduced `search_steps` to 300**: This reduces the number of iterations per search, leading to faster completion of each search cycle. While this might slightly reduce the accuracy, it significantly improves runtime.
2. **Reduced `restarts` to 5**: Fewer restarts mean fewer iterations overall, which directly reduces the total runtime.
3. **Reduced `repeats` to 3**: Fewer repeats further decrease the total number of iterations, leading to a shorter overall runtime.
4. **Adjusted `noise` to 0.05**: Lowering the noise level helps in faster convergence while still allowing some exploration, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
5. **Enabled `lowmemory` to 'True'**: This setting optimizes memory usage, which can prevent memory-related slowdowns and improve overall performance.

By making these adjustments, the runtime performance should be significantly improved while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy and robustness.
