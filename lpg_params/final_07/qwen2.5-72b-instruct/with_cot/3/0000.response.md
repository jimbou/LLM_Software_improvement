To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance, we need to analyze each parameter and understand its impact on the overall execution time. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **search_steps (500)**: This parameter controls the number of steps in the search process. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but will increase runtime.
2. **restarts (9)**: This parameter specifies the number of times the search process is restarted. More restarts can help avoid local optima but will also increase runtime.
3. **repeats (5)**: This parameter determines how many times the entire process is repeated. More repeats can improve the robustness of the results but will increase runtime.
4. **noise (0.1)**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process. The impact on runtime is generally minimal, but it can affect the quality of the results.
5. **static_noise ('None')**: This parameter indicates whether static noise is applied. If set to 'None', no static noise is used. Static noise can add complexity but might not significantly affect runtime.
6. **lowmemory ('None')**: This parameter indicates whether low memory mode is enabled. If set to 'None', it is not enabled. Enabling low memory mode can reduce memory usage but might slightly increase runtime.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Since `search_steps` has a direct impact on runtime, reducing this value can significantly decrease the time taken. However, it should be balanced to ensure the quality of the results is not compromised too much.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Reducing the number of restarts will decrease the total runtime. Again, this should be done carefully to avoid missing out on better solutions.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Similar to `restarts`, reducing the number of repeats will decrease runtime but might affect the robustness of the results.
4. **Optimize `noise`**: The current noise level is moderate. Adjusting this might not have a significant impact on runtime, but it can be fine-tuned to balance between exploration and exploitation.
5. **Consider enabling `lowmemory`**: If memory usage is a concern, enabling low memory mode can help, although it might slightly increase runtime.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

Based on the analysis, here is the optimized configuration:

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Reduced `search_steps` from 500 to 300**: This reduces the number of steps in the search process, which should significantly decrease runtime while still providing reasonable accuracy.
2. **Reduced `restarts` from 9 to 5**: This reduces the number of restarts, which will further decrease runtime. Five restarts should still provide a good balance between avoiding local optima and runtime efficiency.
3. **Reduced `repeats` from 5 to 3**: This reduces the number of times the entire process is repeated, which will decrease runtime. Three repeats should still provide a robust result.
4. **Kept `noise` at 0.1**: The current noise level is moderate and does not significantly impact runtime, so it remains unchanged.
5. **Enabled `lowmemory`**: Enabling low memory mode can help manage memory usage, which might be beneficial if memory is a constraint. It might slightly increase runtime, but the trade-off is often worth it.

These changes should result in a more efficient runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy and robustness in the results.
