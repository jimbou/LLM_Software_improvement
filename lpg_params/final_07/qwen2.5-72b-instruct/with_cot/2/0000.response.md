To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance, we need to carefully analyze each parameter and understand its impact on the overall execution time. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **search_steps (500)**: This parameter determines the number of steps in the search algorithm. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased runtime.
2. **restarts (9)**: This parameter specifies the number of times the search algorithm is restarted. More restarts can help escape local optima but also increase the total runtime.
3. **repeats (5)**: This parameter indicates how many times the entire process is repeated. More repeats can provide more robust results but significantly increase the runtime.
4. **noise (0.1)**: This parameter adds randomness to the search process, which can help explore the solution space more thoroughly but might also introduce unnecessary complexity.
5. **static_noise ('None')**: This parameter, if set to a non-None value, would add a fixed amount of noise. It is currently set to 'None', so it has no effect.
6. **lowmemory ('None')**: This parameter, if set to a non-None value, could enable memory-saving optimizations. It is currently set to 'None', so it has no effect.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Since a higher number of steps increases runtime, reducing this value can help. However, we need to ensure that the reduction does not significantly impact the quality of the results. A good starting point might be to reduce it to 300.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Reducing the number of restarts can also help reduce runtime. A reasonable reduction might be to 5.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Similarly, reducing the number of repeats can significantly decrease runtime. A reduction to 3 might be appropriate.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: The current noise level is 0.1. If the problem allows, reducing this to 0.05 might still provide sufficient exploration while reducing the complexity.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Setting `lowmemory` to 'True' can help reduce memory usage, which might indirectly improve runtime performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Reduced `search_steps` from 500 to 300**: This reduces the number of iterations in the search process, leading to a significant decrease in runtime. The trade-off is a potential slight decrease in result accuracy, but this is often acceptable for many applications.
2. **Reduced `restarts` from 9 to 5**: Fewer restarts mean fewer full runs of the search algorithm, which directly reduces the total runtime. This change balances the need for multiple attempts to find a good solution with the need for faster execution.
3. **Reduced `repeats` from 5 to 3**: Fewer repeats mean the entire process is run fewer times, further reducing the total runtime. This is a significant change in terms of reducing the overall computational load.
4. **Reduced `noise` from 0.1 to 0.05**: Lower noise levels can reduce the complexity of the search process, potentially leading to faster convergence. This is a small adjustment that can have a noticeable impact on runtime.
5. **Enabled `lowmemory` to 'True'**: Enabling low memory mode can help reduce memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime performance by preventing memory-related bottlenecks.

By making these adjustments, the overall runtime should be significantly reduced while maintaining a reasonable level of solution quality.
