### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to consider the impact of each parameter on the overall execution time and the quality of the results. Here's a brief analysis of each parameter:

1. **search_steps**: A higher number of search steps can lead to more accurate results but will increase the runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process but might compromise the quality of the solution.

2. **restarts**: Multiple restarts help in escaping local optima and finding better solutions. However, each restart adds to the total runtime. Reducing the number of restarts can significantly decrease runtime but might also reduce the robustness of the solution.

3. **repeats**: Repeating the entire search process multiple times ensures a more thorough exploration of the solution space but at the cost of increased runtime. Reducing the number of repeats can speed up the process but might miss out on finding the best possible solution.

4. **noise**: Noise introduces randomness which can help in exploring different parts of the solution space. However, too much noise can lead to less stable results. Adjusting this parameter can balance between exploration and exploitation.

5. **static_noise**: Setting this to `True` can help in scenarios where a consistent level of noise is beneficial. However, it might not be as effective in dynamic environments where varying levels of noise can be advantageous.

6. **lowmemory**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory usage, which is beneficial for systems with limited resources. However, it might slightly affect the performance due to additional overhead in managing memory constraints.

### Suggested Adjustments

Based on the analysis, here are the suggested adjustments to improve runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable quality of results:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Decrease the number of search steps to a lower value within the acceptable range to speed up the process.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Decrease the number of restarts to reduce the total runtime.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Decrease the number of repeats to further speed up the process.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: Slightly reduce the noise level to maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Enable low-memory mode to reduce memory consumption, which can be beneficial if the system has limited resources.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **search_steps := 300**: Reducing the number of search steps from 500 to 300 can significantly speed up the algorithm while still allowing for a reasonable number of iterations to find a good solution.
2. **restarts := 5**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 reduces the total runtime without completely sacrificing the ability to escape local optima.
3. **repeats := 3**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 further decreases the runtime while still ensuring some level of robustness in the solution.
4. **noise := 0.05**: Slightly reducing the noise level from 0.1 to 0.05 helps in balancing exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to more stable results.
5. **lowmemory := True**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory consumption, which is particularly useful for resource-constrained environments.

These changes should result in a more efficient runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of solution quality.
