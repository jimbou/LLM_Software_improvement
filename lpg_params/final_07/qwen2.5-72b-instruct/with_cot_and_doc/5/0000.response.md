### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on the execution time of the algorithm. Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of each parameter:

1. **search_steps**: Higher values increase the thoroughness of the search but also increase runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process but might lead to less optimal results.
2. **restarts**: More restarts can help escape local optima but increase runtime. Reducing this can make the process faster but might reduce the quality of the solution.
3. **repeats**: Repeating the search multiple times ensures robustness but increases runtime. Reducing this can speed up the process but might reduce the reliability of the results.
4. **noise**: Higher noise levels can help explore the search space more thoroughly but might slow down convergence. Lowering this can speed up the process but might reduce exploration.
5. **static_noise**: Setting this to `True` can stabilize the search process but might not be beneficial if the problem requires dynamic noise adjustment.
6. **lowmemory**: Enabling this can reduce memory usage, which is useful for resource-constrained environments but might not directly impact runtime.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Since each step takes time, reducing the number of steps can significantly decrease runtime. However, it should not be too low to avoid missing good solutions.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Fewer restarts mean fewer iterations of the search process, which can speed up the algorithm.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Fewer repeats mean the entire process runs fewer times, which can further reduce runtime.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: A moderate level of noise can balance exploration and exploitation. Too much noise can slow down convergence, while too little might lead to premature convergence.
5. **Consider `static_noise`**: If the problem is stable and does not require dynamic noise adjustment, setting this to `True` can help stabilize the search.
6. **Enable `lowmemory`**: If memory usage is a concern, enabling this can help, but it might not directly impact runtime.

### Optimized Configuration

Based on the above analysis, here is the optimized configuration:

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.15
static_noise := 'True'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **search_steps := 300**: Reduced from 500 to 300 to decrease the number of search steps, which should significantly reduce runtime. This is a compromise between thoroughness and speed.
2. **restarts := 5**: Reduced from 9 to 5 to decrease the number of restarts, which will speed up the process while still allowing some attempts to escape local optima.
3. **repeats := 3**: Reduced from 5 to 3 to decrease the number of repetitions, which will further reduce runtime but maintain some level of robustness.
4. **noise := 0.15**: Increased slightly from 0.1 to 0.15 to balance exploration and exploitation. This should help in finding better solutions without significantly increasing runtime.
5. **static_noise := 'True'**: Set to `True` to apply a consistent noise level throughout the search, which can stabilize the process and potentially improve performance.
6. **lowmemory := 'True'**: Enabled to reduce memory usage, which is beneficial in resource-constrained environments and might indirectly contribute to better runtime performance by reducing memory overhead.

These changes should result in a more efficient and faster-running algorithm while maintaining a reasonable level of solution quality.
