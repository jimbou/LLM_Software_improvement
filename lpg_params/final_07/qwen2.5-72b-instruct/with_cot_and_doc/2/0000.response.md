### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on computational resources and efficiency. Here's an analysis of each parameter:

1. **search_steps**: Higher values increase the thoroughness of the search but also increase runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process, but it might affect the quality of the results.
2. **restarts**: More restarts can help escape local optima but increase runtime. Reducing this value can decrease the time taken, but it might reduce the robustness of the solution.
3. **repeats**: Similar to restarts, more repeats ensure a more robust solution but at the cost of increased runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process.
4. **noise**: Higher noise levels can help explore the search space more thoroughly but might slow down convergence. Lowering this value can speed up the process but might lead to premature convergence.
5. **static_noise**: Enabling static noise can simplify the noise mechanism, potentially reducing computational overhead.
6. **lowmemory**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory usage, which is beneficial for systems with limited resources but might slightly increase runtime due to additional overhead.

### Suggested Adjustments

Based on the analysis, here are the suggested adjustments to improve runtime performance:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: From 500 to 300. This reduces the number of iterations, which should significantly decrease runtime while still allowing for a reasonable search.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: From 9 to 5. This reduces the number of restarts, which can further decrease runtime without completely sacrificing the ability to escape local optima.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: From 5 to 3. This reduces the number of repetitions, which can significantly speed up the process.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: From 0.1 to 0.05. This reduces the level of randomness, which can help the algorithm converge faster.
5. **Enable `static_noise`**: Set to `True`. This simplifies the noise mechanism, potentially reducing computational overhead.
6. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Set to `True`. This reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial for systems with limited resources.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := True
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Reducing `search_steps` from 500 to 300**: This change significantly reduces the number of iterations, which directly decreases the runtime. The reduction is balanced to maintain a reasonable search depth.
2. **Reducing `restarts` from 9 to 5**: Fewer restarts mean less time spent on restarting the search process, which speeds up the overall runtime. However, it still allows for multiple attempts to find a good solution.
3. **Reducing `repeats` from 5 to 3**: Fewer repetitions mean the entire search procedure is run fewer times, which further reduces runtime. This is a trade-off between robustness and speed.
4. **Adjusting `noise` from 0.1 to 0.05**: Lowering the noise level helps the algorithm converge faster by reducing the randomness, which can speed up the search process.
5. **Enabling `static_noise`**: Setting `static_noise` to `True` simplifies the noise mechanism, potentially reducing computational overhead and speeding up the process.
6. **Enabling `lowmemory`**: Setting `lowmemory` to `True` reduces memory usage, which is beneficial for systems with limited resources. While this might introduce some additional overhead, the memory savings can be significant.

These changes collectively aim to balance the trade-off between runtime performance and the quality of the solution, ensuring that the algorithm runs faster while still producing acceptable results.
