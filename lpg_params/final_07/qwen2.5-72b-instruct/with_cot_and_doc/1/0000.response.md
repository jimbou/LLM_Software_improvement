### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the runtime performance, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on the execution time. Here's a brief analysis:

1. **search_steps**: A higher number of search steps can increase the accuracy of the search but will also increase the runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process but might affect the quality of the results.

2. **restarts**: More restarts can help escape local optima, but they also increase the overall runtime. Reducing the number of restarts can significantly decrease the runtime, but it might lead to suboptimal solutions.

3. **repeats**: Repeating the search multiple times can improve the robustness of the solution but at the cost of increased runtime. Reducing the number of repeats can speed up the process but might reduce the reliability of the results.

4. **noise**: The level of randomness can affect the exploration of the search space. Lowering the noise can make the search more deterministic and potentially faster, but it might also reduce the ability to explore diverse solutions.

5. **static_noise**: Enabling static noise can simplify the noise management process, which might slightly improve performance by reducing the overhead of dynamic noise adjustment.

6. **lowmemory**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce the memory footprint, which can indirectly improve performance by avoiding memory-related bottlenecks.

### Suggested Adjustments

Based on the analysis, here are the suggested adjustments:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Since each step contributes to the runtime, reducing the number of steps can significantly speed up the process. However, we should ensure that the reduction does not severely impact the quality of the results. Let's try reducing it to 300.

2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Reducing the number of restarts can also significantly decrease the runtime. We can try reducing it to 5.

3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Reducing the number of repeats can further speed up the process. Let's try reducing it to 3.

4. **Adjust `noise`**: Lowering the noise level can make the search more deterministic and potentially faster. Let's try setting it to 0.05.

5. **Enable `static_noise`**: Enabling static noise can simplify the noise management process and potentially improve performance. Set it to `True`.

6. **Enable `lowmemory`**: Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory consumption, which can indirectly improve performance. Set it to `True`.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := True
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Reduced `search_steps` to 300**: This reduces the total number of iterations, leading to a faster execution time while still allowing for a reasonable search depth.
2. **Reduced `restarts` to 5**: Fewer restarts mean fewer cycles through the search process, significantly decreasing the runtime.
3. **Reduced `repeats` to 3**: Fewer repetitions of the entire search procedure further reduce the runtime, though it might slightly decrease the robustness of the solution.
4. **Adjusted `noise` to 0.05**: Lower noise levels make the search more deterministic, potentially speeding up the process without significantly impacting the exploration of the search space.
5. **Enabled `static_noise`**: Simplifies noise management, which can slightly improve performance by reducing overhead.
6. **Enabled `lowmemory`**: Reduces memory consumption, which can indirectly improve performance by avoiding memory-related bottlenecks.

By making these adjustments, the overall runtime should be significantly reduced while maintaining a reasonable balance between performance and solution quality.
