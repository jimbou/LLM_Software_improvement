### Analysis and Optimization

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that significantly impact the computational load and efficiency of the algorithm. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

1. **search_steps**:
   - **Impact**: Higher values increase the thoroughness of the search but also increase the runtime.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the number of search steps can speed up the process, but it should not be too low to avoid missing optimal solutions. A reasonable reduction might be to 300 steps.
   - **Suggested Value**: `300`

2. **restarts**:
   - **Impact**: More restarts can help escape local optima but increase the overall runtime.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the number of restarts can significantly decrease the runtime without drastically affecting the quality of the solution. A moderate value like 5 can be effective.
   - **Suggested Value**: `5`

3. **repeats**:
   - **Impact**: Repeating the search multiple times ensures robustness but increases runtime.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the number of repeats can save time. A value of 3 might be sufficient to maintain robustness while reducing runtime.
   - **Suggested Value**: `3`

4. **noise**:
   - **Impact**: Higher noise levels can help explore more of the search space but can also lead to less precise solutions.
   - **Optimization**: A moderate noise level can balance exploration and exploitation. A value of 0.05 might be a good compromise.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.05`

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Impact**: Setting this to `True` can introduce consistent perturbations, which might help in certain scenarios but can also limit adaptability.
   - **Optimization**: Keeping it at `None` allows for dynamic noise adjustment, which is generally more flexible and adaptive.
   - **Suggested Value**: `None`

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Impact**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory usage, which is beneficial for systems with limited resources.
   - **Optimization**: If memory is not a limiting factor, this can be left as `None`. However, if memory is constrained, setting it to `True` can help.
   - **Suggested Value**: `None` (unless memory is a concern)

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := None
lowmemory := None
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reduced `search_steps` to 300**: This reduces the total number of iterations, speeding up the search process while still allowing for a thorough exploration of the solution space.
- **Reduced `restarts` to 5**: Fewer restarts decrease the runtime while maintaining the ability to escape local optima.
- **Reduced `repeats` to 3**: Fewer repetitions reduce the overall computational load while ensuring some level of robustness.
- **Adjusted `noise` to 0.05**: A lower noise level helps in balancing exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to more precise solutions.
- **Kept `static_noise` as `None`**: Dynamic noise adjustment is generally more flexible and adaptive.
- **Kept `lowmemory` as `None`**: This is optional based on system memory constraints. If memory is not an issue, leaving it as `None` is fine.

These changes should result in a more efficient and faster runtime while maintaining the quality of the search results.
