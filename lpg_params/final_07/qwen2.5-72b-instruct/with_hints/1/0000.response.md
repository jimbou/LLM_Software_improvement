To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: This parameter controls the number of steps in the search algorithm. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased runtime.
2. **restarts**: This parameter determines how many times the search process is restarted. More restarts can improve the chances of finding a better solution but also increase runtime.
3. **repeats**: This parameter specifies how many times the entire process is repeated. More repeats can improve reliability but also extend the total runtime.
4. **noise**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process. A higher value can help escape local minima but might also slow down convergence.
5. **static_noise**: This parameter, if set, adds a fixed amount of noise. It is currently set to 'None', which means no static noise is added.
6. **lowmemory**: This parameter, if set, optimizes memory usage. It is currently set to 'None', indicating no specific low-memory mode is enabled.

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime. However, it should not be reduced too much to avoid poor solution quality. A good balance might be around 300 steps.
   - **Optimized Value**: `search_steps := 300`

2. **restarts**: Reducing the number of restarts can also decrease runtime. However, too few restarts might lead to suboptimal solutions. A reasonable reduction might be to 5.
   - **Optimized Value**: `restarts := 5`

3. **repeats**: Reducing the number of repeats can further decrease runtime. A value of 3 might be sufficient to maintain reliability while reducing runtime.
   - **Optimized Value**: `repeats := 3`

4. **noise**: The current value of 0.1 is moderate. Reducing it slightly might speed up convergence without significantly affecting the solution quality.
   - **Optimized Value**: `noise := 0.05`

5. **static_noise**: Since it is currently set to 'None', we can keep it as is unless there is a specific reason to introduce static noise.
   - **Optimized Value**: `static_noise := 'None'`

6. **lowmemory**: Enabling a low-memory mode can help reduce memory usage, which might indirectly improve runtime performance by reducing memory-related overhead.
   - **Optimized Value**: `lowmemory := 'True'`

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```python
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
- **Reduced search_steps**: From 500 to 300, which should significantly reduce the time spent on each search iteration.
- **Reduced restarts**: From 9 to 5, which reduces the number of times the search process is restarted.
- **Reduced repeats**: From 5 to 3, which reduces the number of times the entire process is repeated.
- **Reduced noise**: From 0.1 to 0.05, which might help speed up convergence.
- **Enabled lowmemory**: Set to 'True' to optimize memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime performance.

These changes should help reduce the overall runtime while maintaining the functionality and quality of the system.
