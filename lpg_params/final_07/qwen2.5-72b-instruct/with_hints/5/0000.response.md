To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters

1. **search_steps (500)**
   - This parameter controls the number of steps in the search algorithm. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased runtime.
   - Reducing this value can significantly decrease runtime, but it must be balanced with the need for accuracy.

2. **restarts (9)**
   - This parameter determines how many times the search algorithm is restarted. More restarts can help escape local optima but increase runtime.
   - Reducing the number of restarts can speed up the process, but it might also reduce the robustness of the solution.

3. **repeats (5)**
   - This parameter specifies how many times the entire process is repeated. Repeating the process multiple times can improve reliability but increases runtime.
   - Reducing the number of repeats can save time, but it might affect the consistency of the results.

4. **noise (0.1)**
   - This parameter introduces randomness into the search process, which can help explore the solution space more thoroughly.
   - Adjusting the noise level can balance exploration and exploitation, potentially improving both performance and accuracy.

5. **static_noise ('None')**
   - This parameter indicates whether static noise is used. If set to 'None', no static noise is applied.
   - Static noise can be useful in certain scenarios, but if not needed, it should remain 'None' to avoid unnecessary complexity.

6. **lowmemory ('None')**
   - This parameter indicates whether low memory mode is enabled. If set to 'None', it is not enabled.
   - Enabling low memory mode can reduce memory usage, which might indirectly improve performance by reducing swapping and other overheads.

### Optimized Parameters

Based on the analysis, here are the optimized parameter values:

```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation

1. **search_steps := 300**
   - Reduced from 500 to 300. This should significantly reduce runtime while still allowing for a reasonable number of search steps to find a good solution.

2. **restarts := 5**
   - Reduced from 9 to 5. This reduces the number of restarts, which can cut down on runtime without completely sacrificing the ability to escape local optima.

3. **repeats := 3**
   - Reduced from 5 to 3. This reduces the number of repetitions, which can further decrease runtime while maintaining some level of reliability.

4. **noise := 0.1**
   - Kept the same. The current value seems appropriate for balancing exploration and exploitation.

5. **static_noise := 'None'**
   - Kept the same. No static noise is necessary unless there is a specific reason to use it.

6. **lowmemory := 'True'**
   - Enabled low memory mode. This can help reduce memory usage, which might improve performance by reducing overhead.

By making these adjustments, the system should experience a noticeable reduction in runtime while still maintaining its core functionality and effectiveness.
