To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and optimized configuration:

### Analysis:
1. **search_steps**: This parameter controls the number of steps in the search process. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased runtime.
2. **restarts**: This parameter determines how many times the search process is restarted. More restarts can improve the chances of finding a better solution but also increase runtime.
3. **repeats**: This parameter specifies how many times the entire process is repeated. More repeats can provide more robust results but will significantly increase runtime.
4. **noise**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process. Lower values can make the search more deterministic, which might be faster but less exploratory.
5. **static_noise**: This parameter is set to 'None', indicating no static noise is added. If this is not necessary for the functionality, it can be left as is.
6. **lowmemory**: This parameter is set to 'None', indicating no low-memory mode is enabled. If the system has sufficient memory, this can be left as is, but if memory is a concern, enabling a low-memory mode could help.

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime. However, it should still be high enough to ensure reasonable accuracy.
   - **Optimized Value**: `search_steps := 300`
2. **restarts**: Reducing the number of restarts can also significantly decrease runtime. However, it should be balanced to ensure the search process has enough attempts to find a good solution.
   - **Optimized Value**: `restarts := 5`
3. **repeats**: Reducing the number of repeats can further decrease runtime. However, it should be balanced to ensure the results are reliable.
   - **Optimized Value**: `repeats := 3`
4. **noise**: Adjusting the noise level can help balance exploration and exploitation. A slightly lower noise level can speed up the process while still allowing some exploration.
   - **Optimized Value**: `noise := 0.05`
5. **static_noise**: Since it is currently set to 'None', and assuming it is not critical for the functionality, it can remain unchanged.
   - **Optimized Value**: `static_noise := 'None'`
6. **lowmemory**: If the system has sufficient memory, this can remain unchanged. However, if memory usage is a concern, enabling a low-memory mode could help.
   - **Optimized Value**: `lowmemory := 'None'` (or enable if necessary)

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'None'
```

These changes should reduce the overall runtime while maintaining the core functionality of the system. If further optimization is needed, you can experiment with slight adjustments to these values to find the best balance between performance and accuracy.
