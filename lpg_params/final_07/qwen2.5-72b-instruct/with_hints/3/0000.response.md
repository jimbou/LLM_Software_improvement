To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **search_steps**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime, but it might also affect the quality of the results. A balanced approach is to reduce it moderately.
  - **Optimized Value**: `250`
  
- **restarts**: The number of restarts can be reduced to lower the overall computational load. However, too few restarts might not allow the system to explore enough solutions.
  - **Optimized Value**: `3`
  
- **repeats**: Repeating the process multiple times can ensure robustness, but it also increases runtime. Reducing this value can help, especially if the system is already stable.
  - **Optimized Value**: `3`
  
- **noise**: The noise level can remain the same as it is crucial for exploration and avoiding local optima. However, if the system is sensitive to noise, you might consider slightly reducing it.
  - **Optimized Value**: `0.1` (unchanged)
  
- **static_noise**: This parameter is set to `'None'`, which means no static noise is applied. If this is not necessary for the system's functionality, it can remain unchanged.
  - **Optimized Value**: `'None'` (unchanged)
  
- **lowmemory**: If memory usage is not a critical issue, this parameter can remain `'None'`. However, if memory optimization is needed, setting it to `'True'` could help.
  - **Optimized Value**: `'None'` (unchanged) or `'True'` if memory optimization is required.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 250
restarts := 3
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'None'
```

### Explanation:
- **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 250 to halve the search time while still allowing sufficient exploration.
- **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 3 to decrease the number of restarts, which can significantly reduce runtime.
- **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3 to cut down on repeated computations, which can save time without severely impacting robustness.
- **noise**: Kept at 0.1 to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation.
- **static_noise**: Kept as `'None'` since it does not appear to be necessary for the system's functionality.
- **lowmemory**: Kept as `'None'` unless memory optimization is a priority.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the essential functionality of the system.
