To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: This parameter controls the number of steps in the search algorithm. A higher value can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased runtime.
2. **restarts**: This parameter determines how many times the search algorithm is restarted. More restarts can improve the chances of finding a better solution but also increase runtime.
3. **repeats**: This parameter specifies how many times the entire process is repeated. More repeats can improve robustness but also increase runtime.
4. **noise**: This parameter introduces randomness into the search process. Lower values can make the search more deterministic, potentially reducing the need for multiple restarts or repeats.
5. **static_noise**: This parameter is set to 'None', indicating no static noise is applied. If static noise is not necessary, it should remain as 'None'.
6. **lowmemory**: This parameter is set to 'None', indicating no low memory mode is enabled. If the system has sufficient memory, this can be left as 'None'.

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime. However, it should not be reduced too much to avoid underfitting. A good starting point might be to reduce it to 300.
   - **Optimized Value**: `search_steps := 300`

2. **restarts**: Reducing the number of restarts can also help in decreasing runtime. A value of 5 might be a good balance between performance and accuracy.
   - **Optimized Value**: `restarts := 5`

3. **repeats**: Reducing the number of repeats can further decrease runtime. A value of 3 might be sufficient to maintain robustness.
   - **Optimized Value**: `repeats := 3`

4. **noise**: Slightly reducing the noise can make the search more deterministic, potentially reducing the need for multiple restarts or repeats. A value of 0.05 might be appropriate.
   - **Optimized Value**: `noise := 0.05`

5. **static_noise**: Since it is currently set to 'None' and no static noise is needed, it should remain unchanged.
   - **Optimized Value**: `static_noise := 'None'`

6. **lowmemory**: If the system has sufficient memory, this can remain as 'None'. If memory is a concern, enabling low memory mode might be beneficial.
   - **Optimized Value**: `lowmemory := 'None'` (or enable if memory is a concern)

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'None'
```

### Explanation:
- **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300 to decrease the computational load per search.
- **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5 to decrease the number of restarts, which can significantly reduce runtime.
- **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3 to further decrease the overall runtime while maintaining some level of robustness.
- **noise**: Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05 to make the search more deterministic, potentially reducing the need for multiple restarts or repeats.
- **static_noise** and **lowmemory**: Kept as 'None' since they do not directly impact runtime performance and are not necessary for the current configuration.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality and robustness of the system.
