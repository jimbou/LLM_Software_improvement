To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the trade-offs between computational resources and the quality of the results. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to optimizing the parameters:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: The number of search steps is a significant factor in runtime. Reducing this can significantly decrease the time taken, but it may also affect the quality of the solution. A good starting point might be to reduce it by half or more, depending on the problem's complexity.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Each restart adds to the total computation time. Reducing the number of restarts can help, but it may also reduce the chances of finding a better solution. A reasonable reduction might be to cut it in half.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Repeating the process multiple times can be computationally expensive. Reducing the number of repeats can help, but it may also reduce the robustness of the solution. A reduction to 3 or 4 might be a good balance.
4. **Adjust `noise` and `static_noise`**: Noise can help explore the solution space, but too much noise can slow down convergence. If the problem is not highly stochastic, reducing the noise level can help. Setting `static_noise` to a non-None value can also help stabilize the search process.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: If the problem is memory-intensive, enabling low memory mode can help reduce the overall runtime by optimizing memory usage.

Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
```python
search_steps := 250  # Reduced from 500
restarts := 5       # Reduced from 9
repeats := 3        # Reduced from 5
noise := 0.05       # Reduced from 0.1
static_noise := 'True'  # Set to True to stabilize the search
lowmemory := 'True'     # Enable low memory mode
```

### Explanation:
- **`search_steps = 250`**: Halving the number of search steps reduces the computational load significantly while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the solution space.
- **`restarts = 5`**: Reducing the number of restarts by half helps to speed up the process without completely sacrificing the chance of finding a better solution.
- **`repeats = 3`**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 balances the need for robustness with the need for faster runtime.
- **`noise = 0.05`**: Reducing the noise level can help the algorithm converge faster, especially if the problem is not highly stochastic.
- **`static_noise = 'True'`**: Enabling static noise can help stabilize the search process, potentially leading to more efficient convergence.
- **`lowmemory = 'True'`**: Enabling low memory mode can help reduce the overall runtime by optimizing memory usage, which is particularly useful for large-scale problems.

These optimizations should provide a good balance between runtime efficiency and solution quality. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific characteristics of your problem.
