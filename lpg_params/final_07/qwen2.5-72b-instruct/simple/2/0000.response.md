To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the trade-offs between computational cost and the quality of the results. Here are some strategies and the optimized parameters:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: The number of search steps directly impacts the runtime. Reducing this can significantly speed up the process, but it might also reduce the quality of the solution. A good starting point is to halve it and see if the results are still acceptable.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Each restart adds to the overall runtime. Reducing the number of restarts can help, but you need to ensure that the solution quality remains reasonable.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Repeating the process multiple times can be computationally expensive. Reducing the number of repeats can help, but again, monitor the impact on solution quality.
4. **Adjust `noise`**: Noise can affect the convergence rate. If the noise level is too high, it might slow down the convergence. Lowering the noise slightly can help.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: If the memory usage is a concern, enabling the low memory mode can help, but it might not have a significant impact on runtime.

Here are the optimized parameters:

```python
search_steps = 250  # Reduced from 500
restarts = 5       # Reduced from 9
repeats = 3        # Reduced from 5
noise = 0.05       # Reduced from 0.1
static_noise = 'None'  # No change
lowmemory = 'True'  # Enabled low memory mode
```

### Explanation:
- **`search_steps = 250`**: Halving the search steps can significantly reduce the runtime while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the solution space.
- **`restarts = 5`**: Reducing the number of restarts by half can cut down the total number of iterations, which should speed up the process.
- **`repeats = 3`**: Reducing the number of repeats can further decrease the runtime, but it's important to ensure that the solution is still robust.
- **`noise = 0.05`**: Slightly reducing the noise level can help with faster convergence.
- **`lowmemory = 'True'`**: Enabling low memory mode can help manage resources better, although its impact on runtime might be minimal.

These changes should provide a good balance between runtime efficiency and solution quality. However, it's always a good idea to test these parameters on a subset of your data to ensure that the performance and solution quality meet your requirements.
