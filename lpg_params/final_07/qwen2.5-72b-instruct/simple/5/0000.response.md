To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to balance between computational resources and the quality of the results. Here are some considerations and adjustments:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: The number of search steps directly impacts the runtime. Reducing this can significantly speed up the process, but it may also reduce the quality of the solution. A good starting point might be to halve the value.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Each restart involves reinitializing the search, which can be time-consuming. Reducing the number of restarts can help, but you should ensure that the reduction doesn't compromise the robustness of the solution too much.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Repeating the entire process multiple times can be very resource-intensive. Reducing the number of repeats can save a lot of time, but again, it may affect the reliability of the results.
4. **Adjust `noise` and `static_noise`**: Noise can add variability to the search, which can be useful but also computationally expensive. If the noise is not critical, reducing it or setting it to a lower value can help. Setting `static_noise` to a specific value (if applicable) can also help stabilize the process.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: If the low memory mode is available and does not significantly impact the results, enabling it can help reduce memory usage and potentially improve runtime.

Based on these considerations, here is an optimized set of parameters:

```python
search_steps = 250  # Reduced from 500 to 250
restarts = 5       # Reduced from 9 to 5
repeats = 3        # Reduced from 5 to 3
noise = 0.05       # Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05
static_noise = 'None'  # Keep as None if not needed
lowmemory = 'True'  # Enable low memory mode if available
```

### Explanation:
- **`search_steps = 250`**: Halving the search steps can significantly reduce runtime while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the search space.
- **`restarts = 5`**: Reducing the number of restarts by half can save a lot of time without completely sacrificing the robustness of the solution.
- **`repeats = 3`**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can further speed up the process, but it's still enough to provide some level of reliability.
- **`noise = 0.05`**: Reducing the noise level can make the search more efficient, especially if the noise was primarily for exploration purposes.
- **`static_noise = 'None'`**: Keeping this as `None` unless there is a specific reason to use static noise.
- **`lowmemory = 'True'`**: Enabling low memory mode can help reduce memory usage and potentially improve runtime, especially if the system has limited resources.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime efficiency while maintaining a reasonable level of solution quality.
