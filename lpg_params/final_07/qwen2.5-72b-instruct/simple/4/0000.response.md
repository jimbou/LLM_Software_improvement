To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the trade-offs between computational cost and the quality of the results. Here’s a step-by-step approach to optimizing the parameters:

1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: The number of search steps is a significant factor in runtime. Reducing this can significantly speed up the process, but it may also reduce the quality of the solution. A good starting point might be to halve it.
2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Each restart adds to the overall runtime. Reducing the number of restarts can help, but you should ensure that the reduction does not compromise the robustness of the solution too much.
3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Repeating the process multiple times can improve the reliability of the results, but it also increases runtime. Reducing the number of repeats can help, especially if the results are already stable.
4. **Optimize `noise`**: Noise can help escape local minima, but too much noise can slow down convergence. If the current noise level is not critical, reducing it slightly can help.
5. **Enable `lowmemory`**: If memory usage is a concern, enabling low memory mode can help, but it might not have a direct impact on runtime. However, it can indirectly improve performance by reducing memory overhead.

Here’s an optimized set of parameters:

```python
search_steps := 250  # Reduced from 500 to 250
restarts := 5       # Reduced from 9 to 5
repeats := 3        # Reduced from 5 to 3
noise := 0.05       # Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05
static_noise := 'None'  # No change
lowmemory := 'True'  # Enabled low memory mode
```

### Explanation:
- **`search_steps = 250`**: Halving the search steps reduces the computational load while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the search space.
- **`restarts = 5`**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 cuts down on the total number of iterations, which can significantly reduce runtime.
- **`repeats = 3`**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can help, as each repeat adds to the total runtime. This assumes that the results are relatively stable with fewer repeats.
- **`noise = 0.05`**: Slightly reducing the noise can help speed up convergence without losing the ability to escape local minima.
- **`lowmemory = 'True'`**: Enabling low memory mode can help reduce memory overhead, which can indirectly improve performance.

These changes should provide a good balance between runtime efficiency and the quality of the results. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
