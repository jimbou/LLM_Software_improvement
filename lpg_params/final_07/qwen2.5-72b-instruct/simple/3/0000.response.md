To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to balance between the thoroughness of the search and the computational cost. Hereâ€™s an analysis and optimization of each parameter:

1. **search_steps**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime, but too few steps might not allow the algorithm to converge properly. A good compromise might be to reduce this from 500 to 300.

2. **restarts**: Multiple restarts help in avoiding local optima but increase the overall runtime. Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 3 can still provide a reasonable exploration while reducing runtime.

3. **repeats**: Repeating the process multiple times ensures robustness but increases runtime. Reducing repeats from 5 to 2 can help in achieving a balance.

4. **noise**: Noise is often used to add randomness to the search, which can help in escaping local optima. However, if the noise level is too high, it can lead to unnecessary computations. The current value of 0.1 seems reasonable and can be kept as is.

5. **static_noise**: If set to 'None', no static noise is applied. This is generally fine unless there is a specific reason to introduce static noise, so it can remain 'None'.

6. **lowmemory**: Setting this to 'True' can help in reducing memory usage, which indirectly affects runtime by reducing the overhead of memory management. It should be set to 'True' if memory management is a concern.

### Optimized Parameters:
```python
search_steps := 300
restarts := 3
repeats := 2
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
- **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300 to decrease the number of iterations.
- **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 3 to decrease the number of restarts.
- **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 2 to decrease the number of repetitions.
- **noise**: Kept at 0.1 as it provides a good balance of randomness.
- **static_noise**: Kept as 'None' since static noise is not necessary.
- **lowmemory**: Set to 'True' to optimize memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime.

These changes should help in achieving better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of search thoroughness.
