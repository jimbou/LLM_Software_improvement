To optimize the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Based on the provided documentation, the following parameters are critical:

1. **search_steps**: Higher values increase the thoroughness of the search but also increase runtime.
2. **restarts**: More restarts can improve the chances of finding a better solution but at the cost of increased runtime.
3. **repeats**: Repeating the search multiple times can enhance the robustness of the results but will also increase runtime.
4. **noise**: While not directly impacting runtime as much as the above, it can affect the efficiency of the search process.
5. **static_noise**: Can potentially simplify the search process if set to `True`, but this depends on the specific use case.
6. **lowmemory**: Reduces memory usage, which can indirectly improve performance by preventing memory bottlenecks.

### Optimized Configuration:
To balance performance and functionality, consider the following adjustments:

- **Reduce `search_steps`**: Since each search step contributes to the total runtime, reducing the number of steps can significantly decrease the time taken. However, it should still be high enough to ensure a thorough search.
  - **Suggested Value**: `300` (a 40% reduction from the default).

- **Reduce `restarts`**: Fewer restarts will reduce the overall runtime, but too few might lead to suboptimal solutions.
  - **Suggested Value**: `5` (a 44% reduction from the default).

- **Reduce `repeats`**: Fewer repetitions will further decrease runtime, but it should still be sufficient to ensure reliability.
  - **Suggested Value**: `3` (a 40% reduction from the default).

- **Adjust `noise`**: A moderate noise level can help the search escape local minima without overly complicating the process.
  - **Suggested Value**: `0.1` (keep the default for now, but monitor if it needs adjustment).

- **Enable `static_noise`**: Setting this to `True` can simplify the search process and potentially speed up the algorithm.
  - **Suggested Value**: `True`.

- **Enable `lowmemory`**: This can help reduce memory usage, which is beneficial for performance.
  - **Suggested Value**: `True`.

### Final Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := True
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation:
- **search_steps = 300**: Reduces the number of steps by 40%, which should still allow for a reasonably thorough search while significantly reducing runtime.
- **restarts = 5**: Reduces the number of restarts by 44%, which helps in reducing the total runtime while still allowing multiple attempts to find a good solution.
- **repeats = 3**: Reduces the number of repetitions by 40%, which further decreases runtime while maintaining some level of robustness.
- **noise = 0.1**: Kept the same to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation.
- **static_noise = True**: Simplifies the search process by applying a consistent noise level, which can speed up the algorithm.
- **lowmemory = True**: Reduces memory usage, which can indirectly improve performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.

These changes should provide a good balance between performance and the effectiveness of the search algorithm.
