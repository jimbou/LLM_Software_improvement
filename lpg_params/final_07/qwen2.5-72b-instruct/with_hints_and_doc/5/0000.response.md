To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **search_steps**:
   - **Current Value**: 500
   - **Optimized Value**: 300
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease the runtime. A value of 300 should still provide a reasonable search depth while improving performance.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Current Value**: 9
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of restarts can also speed up the process. Five restarts should be sufficient to explore different parts of the search space without excessive overhead.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Current Value**: 5
   - **Optimized Value**: 3
   - **Rationale**: Lowering the number of repeats can further reduce the runtime. Three repeats should still provide enough robustness to the search process.

4. **noise**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.1
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.1
   - **Rationale**: The noise level is already set to a moderate value, which is generally good for balancing exploration and exploitation. No change is necessary here.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Current Value**: None
   - **Optimized Value**: None
   - **Rationale**: Enabling static noise might not necessarily improve performance and could introduce additional complexity. Keeping it as `None` is appropriate.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Current Value**: None
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Rationale**: Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory consumption, which can indirectly improve performance by reducing the likelihood of memory-related bottlenecks.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Summary:
- **search_steps** reduced from 500 to 300.
- **restarts** reduced from 9 to 5.
- **repeats** reduced from 5 to 3.
- **lowmemory** enabled to `True`.

These changes should help reduce the overall runtime of the algorithm while maintaining its effectiveness.
