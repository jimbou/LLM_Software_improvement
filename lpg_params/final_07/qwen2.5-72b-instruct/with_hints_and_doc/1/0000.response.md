To optimize the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **search_steps**: A higher value increases the thoroughness of the search but also increases runtime. Reducing this value can significantly speed up the process, but it might lead to less optimal results.
2. **restarts**: Multiple restarts help escape local optima but increase runtime. Reducing the number of restarts can decrease runtime but might reduce the robustness of the solution.
3. **repeats**: Repeating the search multiple times ensures more reliable results but at the cost of increased runtime. Reducing this value can speed up the process but might affect the reliability.
4. **noise**: Higher noise levels can help explore the search space more thoroughly but can also introduce unnecessary randomness. Adjusting this value can balance exploration and exploitation.
5. **static_noise**: Setting this to `True` can reduce the overhead of dynamically adjusting noise levels, potentially improving performance.
6. **lowmemory**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce memory usage, which might indirectly improve performance by reducing swapping and other memory-related overheads.

### Suggested Optimizations:
1. **Reduce `search_steps`**: Lowering the number of search steps can significantly reduce runtime. However, it should not be too low to ensure a reasonable search.
   - **Suggested Value**: `300`

2. **Reduce `restarts`**: Fewer restarts will speed up the process but still allow for some robustness.
   - **Suggested Value**: `5`

3. **Reduce `repeats`**: Fewer repetitions will decrease runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of reliability.
   - **Suggested Value**: `3`

4. **Adjust `noise`**: A moderate noise level can help balance exploration and exploitation.
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.05`

5. **Enable `static_noise`**: This can reduce the overhead of dynamically adjusting noise levels.
   - **Suggested Value**: `True`

6. **Enable `lowmemory`**: This can reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.
   - **Suggested Value**: `True`

### Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := True
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation:
- **search_steps = 300**: Reduces the number of search steps, speeding up the process while still allowing for a reasonable search.
- **restarts = 5**: Reduces the number of restarts, balancing between robustness and runtime.
- **repeats = 3**: Reduces the number of repetitions, decreasing runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of reliability.
- **noise = 0.05**: Moderates the level of randomness, helping to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **static_noise = True**: Reduces the overhead of dynamically adjusting noise levels.
- **lowmemory = True**: Reduces memory usage, potentially improving performance by reducing memory-related overheads.

These changes should help in reducing the overall runtime while maintaining the functionality and reliability of the system.
