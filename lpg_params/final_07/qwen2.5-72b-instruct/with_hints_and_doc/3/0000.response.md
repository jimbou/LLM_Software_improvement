To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we can focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**:
   - **Optimized Value**: 300
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of search steps from 500 to 300 can significantly decrease the runtime. This is a good starting point for optimization, as it directly reduces the computational load without drastically affecting the quality of the search.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of restarts from 9 to 5 can further improve runtime performance. Each restart adds to the total computation time, so fewer restarts mean faster execution. However, this should be balanced with the need for sufficient exploration of the search space.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Optimized Value**: 3
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of repeats from 5 to 3 can also help in reducing the overall runtime. Repeating the search multiple times ensures robustness but increases the computational cost. Three repeats provide a reasonable balance between performance and reliability.

4. **noise**:
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.1
   - **Rationale**: The noise parameter is kept at its default value of 0.1. This parameter introduces randomness, which is important for exploring different parts of the search space. Changing it might affect the search quality, so it's best to keep it unchanged unless there are specific reasons to adjust it.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Optimized Value**: None
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this parameter as `None` means that dynamic noise is used, which is generally more flexible and can adapt to the search process. Setting it to `True` would introduce a fixed noise level, which might not be as effective in all scenarios.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Rationale**: Enabling low-memory mode (`True`) can help reduce memory consumption, which can indirectly improve performance by preventing memory-related bottlenecks. This is particularly useful if the system has limited memory resources.

### Summary:
By reducing the number of search steps, restarts, and repeats, and enabling low-memory mode, we can achieve a more efficient configuration that maintains the essential functionality of the system. These changes should lead to a noticeable reduction in runtime while still providing a robust search process.
