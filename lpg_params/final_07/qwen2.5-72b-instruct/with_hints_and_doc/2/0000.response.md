To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **search_steps**:
   - **Current Value**: 500
   - **Optimized Value**: 300
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the number of search steps can significantly decrease runtime. Since the default value is 500, reducing it to 300 should still provide a reasonable number of iterations for the algorithm to converge, but with faster execution.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Current Value**: 9
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: The number of restarts can also be reduced to speed up the process. With fewer restarts, the algorithm will complete its runs more quickly. However, reducing it too much might affect the quality of the solution, so a balance is needed.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Current Value**: 5
   - **Optimized Value**: 3
   - **Rationale**: Similar to restarts, reducing the number of repeats can help reduce overall runtime. A value of 3 should still allow for multiple runs to ensure robustness without excessive computation.

4. **noise**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.1
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.1
   - **Rationale**: The noise parameter is crucial for exploration and can affect the quality of the solution. Keeping it at 0.1 maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Current Value**: None
   - **Optimized Value**: None
   - **Rationale**: Static noise is not necessary unless you specifically need a consistent level of perturbation throughout the search. Keeping it as `None` allows for dynamic adjustment of noise, which can be beneficial in many scenarios.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Current Value**: None
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Rationale**: Enabling low-memory mode can significantly reduce memory consumption, which can lead to better performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Summary:
- **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300 to speed up each search iteration.
- **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5 to decrease the number of restarts.
- **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3 to minimize the number of full runs.
- **noise**: Kept at 0.1 to maintain a balanced level of exploration.
- **static_noise**: Kept as `None` to allow dynamic noise adjustment.
- **lowmemory**: Set to `True` to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

This configuration should provide a good balance between runtime performance and the quality of the solution.
