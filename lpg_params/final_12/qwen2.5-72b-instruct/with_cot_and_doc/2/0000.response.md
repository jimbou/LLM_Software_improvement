```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**:
   - **Original Value**: 500
   - **New Value**: 300
   - **Impact**: Reducing the number of search steps can decrease the runtime, but it might also reduce the thoroughness of the search. A value of 300 strikes a balance between performance and effectiveness.

2. **restarts**:
   - **Original Value**: 9
   - **New Value**: 5
   - **Impact**: Decreasing the number of restarts reduces the overall computational load, which can significantly speed up the process. However, fewer restarts might lead to suboptimal solutions.

3. **repeats**:
   - **Original Value**: 5
   - **New Value**: 3
   - **Impact**: Reducing the number of repeats further decreases the runtime, but it also means the algorithm has fewer opportunities to refine its results.

4. **noise**:
   - **Original Value**: 0.1
   - **New Value**: 0.05
   - **Impact**: Lowering the noise level can make the search more deterministic and potentially faster, although it might also make the search less robust to local optima.

5. **static_noise**:
   - **Original Value**: None
   - **New Value**: None
   - **Impact**: No change is made here because the default setting of `None` is appropriate unless there is a specific need for static noise.

6. **lowmemory**:
   - **Original Value**: None
   - **New Value**: True
   - **Impact**: Enabling low-memory mode can reduce the memory footprint of the algorithm, which can be beneficial for systems with limited resources. This can indirectly improve performance by reducing memory-related bottlenecks.

By making these adjustments, the overall runtime should be reduced while still maintaining a reasonable level of search effectiveness.
