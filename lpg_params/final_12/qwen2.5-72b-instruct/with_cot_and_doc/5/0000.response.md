```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := None
lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300. Fewer search steps can reduce the overall runtime without significantly impacting the quality of the solution, especially if the problem space is not extremely complex.

2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Fewer restarts mean less time spent on reinitializing the search, which can speed up the process. However, this might slightly reduce the chances of finding a better solution, so a balance is needed.

3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Reducing the number of repeats can significantly decrease the runtime, as each repeat involves running the entire search process again. This is a trade-off between thoroughness and speed.

4. **noise**: Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05. Lower noise can make the search more deterministic, potentially leading to faster convergence, although it might also reduce exploration.

5. **static_noise**: Left as `None`. Enabling static noise can introduce unnecessary complexity and might not provide significant benefits for performance optimization in this context.

6. **lowmemory**: Set to `True`. Enabling low-memory mode can help reduce memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime performance by avoiding memory-related bottlenecks.
