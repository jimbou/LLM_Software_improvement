lowmemory := True
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Increased from 500 to 750. More search steps can potentially lead to better optimization results, but at the cost of increased runtime. However, this increase is balanced by reducing other parameters to mitigate the overall impact on performance.

2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Fewer restarts reduce the total number of times the search process is restarted, which can significantly decrease the runtime without necessarily sacrificing the quality of the solution.

3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Fewer repeats mean the entire search procedure is run fewer times, further reducing the runtime. This is a trade-off between thoroughness and speed.

4. **noise**: Increased from 0.1 to 0.15. Slightly higher noise can help explore more of the search space, potentially leading to better solutions, especially in complex optimization problems. However, it's kept moderate to avoid excessive randomness.

5. **static_noise**: Kept as `None`. Static noise is not enabled because dynamic noise adjustment is generally more effective in exploring the search space.

6. **lowmemory**: Set to `True`. Enabling low-memory mode reduces memory consumption, which can be beneficial for systems with limited resources, potentially improving runtime performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between thoroughness and efficiency, optimizing the runtime while still achieving good results.
