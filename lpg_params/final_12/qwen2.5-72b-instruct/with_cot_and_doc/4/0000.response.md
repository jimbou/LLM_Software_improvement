```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.1
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300. Fewer search steps can decrease runtime, but this should be balanced to ensure the algorithm still explores the solution space adequately.
2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Reducing the number of restarts decreases the total number of times the search process is initiated, which can significantly reduce runtime without drastically affecting the quality of the solution.
3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Fewer repeats mean the entire search procedure is executed fewer times, which can further reduce runtime.
4. **noise**: Kept at 0.1. The noise level remains unchanged as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
5. **static_noise**: Kept as `None`. Static noise is not enabled, as dynamic noise is generally more effective for exploring different parts of the search space.
6. **lowmemory**: Set to `True`. Enabling low-memory mode reduces memory consumption, which can indirectly improve runtime performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.

These adjustments aim to optimize the runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of search thoroughness and solution quality.
