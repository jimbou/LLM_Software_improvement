```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Increased from 500 to 750. More search steps can help the algorithm explore more of the solution space, potentially leading to better solutions. However, this increase should be balanced against the additional runtime.

2. **restarts**: Decreased from 9 to 5. Reducing the number of restarts can decrease the overall runtime while still allowing the algorithm to escape local optima multiple times.

3. **repeats**: Decreased from 5 to 3. Fewer repetitions reduce the total runtime but maintain enough runs to ensure reliability and robustness of the results.

4. **noise**: Decreased from 0.1 to 0.05. Lower noise can lead to more stable and deterministic search processes, which might improve the quality of the solutions found, especially if the problem is sensitive to high levels of randomness.

5. **static_noise**: Kept as `None`. Dynamic noise is generally more effective in exploring the solution space compared to static noise.

6. **lowmemory**: Set to `True`. Enabling low-memory mode reduces memory consumption, which can be crucial for running the algorithm on systems with limited resources and can also improve runtime performance by reducing memory overhead.
