```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'None'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing from 500 to 300 can decrease the total runtime while still providing sufficient iterations for the search process to converge on a good solution.
2. **restarts**: Lowering from 9 to 5 reduces the number of times the search process is restarted, which can significantly cut down on runtime without drastically affecting the quality of the results.
3. **repeats**: Decreasing from 5 to 3 reduces the number of repetitions, further optimizing runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of reliability in the results.
4. **noise**: Reducing from 0.1 to 0.05 can help in stabilizing the search process and potentially improving the convergence rate, leading to more efficient runtime.
5. **static_noise**: Keeping it as 'None' since introducing static noise might not be necessary and could complicate the process.
6. **lowmemory**: Setting this to 'True' optimizes memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime performance by reducing memory-related overhead.

These adjustments aim to balance between performance and the quality of the results, ensuring that the runtime is minimized while still achieving satisfactory outcomes.
