```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing from 500 to 300 can significantly decrease the runtime while still allowing for a reasonable exploration of the search space. This is a balance between thoroughness and efficiency.

2. **restarts**: Decreasing from 9 to 5 reduces the number of times the algorithm starts over, which can save a lot of time, especially if each restart is computationally expensive. This is often sufficient to find good solutions without excessive redundancy.

3. **repeats**: Reducing from 5 to 3 can help speed up the process. While fewer repeats mean less averaging and potentially less robust results, it can still provide acceptable performance in many scenarios.

4. **noise**: Lowering from 0.1 to 0.05 reduces the randomness in the search, which can lead to more deterministic and faster convergence, although it might also reduce the exploration of the solution space.

5. **static_noise**: Setting this to 'True' can introduce a fixed level of noise, which can sometimes help in avoiding local minima and improving the robustness of the search without the overhead of dynamic noise adjustment.

6. **lowmemory**: Setting this to 'True' can optimize memory usage, which can indirectly improve runtime performance by reducing the time spent on memory management tasks.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between performance and computational efficiency, ensuring that the algorithm runs faster while still achieving acceptable results.
