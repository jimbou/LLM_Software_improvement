```plaintext
search_steps := 300
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'False'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300. This can significantly reduce the overall runtime, especially if the search space is large and many steps are not necessary to find a good solution.
2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Fewer restarts mean fewer full runs of the search process, which can speed up the runtime without drastically affecting the quality of the solution.
3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Fewer repeats will decrease the total number of iterations, which can help in reducing runtime while still maintaining some level of robustness.
4. **noise**: Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05. Lower noise can make the search more stable and potentially faster, as it reduces the randomness that might lead to suboptimal paths.
5. **static_noise**: Set to 'False'. Disabling static noise can simplify the process and reduce unnecessary computational overhead.
6. **lowmemory**: Set to 'True'. Enabling low memory mode can optimize resource usage, which might indirectly improve performance by preventing memory bottlenecks.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-off between runtime efficiency and the quality of the results.
