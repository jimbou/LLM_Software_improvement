```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reduced from 500 to 300. This parameter controls the number of steps in the search process. Reducing it can significantly decrease runtime, especially if the algorithm converges quickly or if the problem space is not extremely large.

2. **restarts**: Reduced from 9 to 5. Restarting the search multiple times can help escape local optima, but too many restarts can be computationally expensive. Reducing this value can save time while still allowing for some exploration.

3. **repeats**: Reduced from 5 to 3. Repeating the entire process multiple times can provide more robust results, but each repetition adds to the total runtime. A reduction here can lead to faster execution without drastically affecting the quality of the results.

4. **noise**: Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05. Noise can help explore the search space, but too much noise can slow down convergence and increase runtime. A smaller noise level can still provide some exploration benefits while being more efficient.

5. **static_noise**: Kept as 'None'. This parameter is not set to any value that would impact performance, so no change is necessary.

6. **lowmemory**: Set to 'True'. Enabling low memory mode can reduce memory usage and potentially improve runtime performance by optimizing memory management, especially if the system has limited resources.

These adjustments aim to balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the search results, leading to improved runtime performance.
