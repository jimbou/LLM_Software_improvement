```plaintext
search_steps := 250
restarts := 5
repeats := 3
noise := 0.05
static_noise := 'False'
lowmemory := 'True'
```

### Explanation:
1. **search_steps**: Reducing from 500 to 250 can decrease the computational load while still allowing for a sufficient number of iterations to find a good solution.
2. **restarts**: Decreasing from 9 to 5 reduces the number of times the search process is restarted, which can save time without significantly impacting the quality of the results.
3. **repeats**: Reducing from 5 to 3 can help reduce redundancy and speed up the process, assuming the problem does not require extensive repetition to achieve stable results.
4. **noise**: Lowering from 0.1 to 0.05 can make the search more precise, potentially leading to better performance by reducing unnecessary randomness.
5. **static_noise**: Setting to 'False' ensures that dynamic noise is used, which can adapt better to the problem and potentially lead to more efficient exploration.
6. **lowmemory**: Enabling this option by setting it to 'True' can help manage memory usage, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where resources are limited, thus improving overall performance.
