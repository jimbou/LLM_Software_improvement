To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to focus on the parameters that directly impact performance in terms of speed and resource utilization. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each parameter and suggestions for optimization:

1. **level**: This parameter typically refers to the compression level. Higher values provide better compression but take longer to process. For runtime efficiency, it's advisable to use a lower compression level unless very high compression is necessary. 
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Set `level := 3` for a good balance between compression and speed.

2. **wbits**: This parameter generally determines the window size for compression algorithms. A larger window size can lead to better compression but can also increase memory usage and processing time.
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Set `wbits := 11`. This will reduce memory usage and improve speed while still maintaining decent compression.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter specifies the amount of memory used for internal compression state. Higher values use more memory for potentially better compression but can slow down the process. For runtime efficiency, a lower memory level is preferable.
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Set `memLevel := 4`. This reduces memory usage and improves speed without severely impacting the compression ratio.

4. **strategy**: This parameter can influence the algorithm's behavior, where lower values may prioritize speed over compression or vice versa. A strategy value of `0` indicates a default strategy.
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: If speed is crucial, you might want to try `strategy := 1` (filtered) for data that has some regular patterns, or `strategy := 2` (huffman) for general data. For the best runtime performance, keeping it at `0` is often fine unless specific characteristics of the data suggest otherwise.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3
- **wbits**: 11
- **memLevel**: 4
- **strategy**: 0 (or 1 for specific cases)

### Summary:
The optimized parameters for best runtime performance without compromising functionality are:
```plaintext
level := 3
wbits := 11
memLevel := 4
strategy := 0 (or 1 as needed)
```
These adjustments should enhance runtime efficiency while maintaining adequate compression levels based on the typical use cases of the compression algorithm.
