To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency in a compression algorithm (likely referring to zlib or a similar library), we need to consider how each parameter affects performance:

1. **level**: This parameter typically controls the compression level, with higher values resulting in better compression ratios but slower performance. Lower levels prioritize speed over compression efficiency. For runtime efficiency:
   - **Suggestion**: Set `level` to `1` or `2` to achieve a balance that favors speed. This provides a quick compression time with a reasonable compression ratio.

2. **wbits**: This parameter defines the window size for compression. A larger window size can improve compression ratios but also increases memory usage and may slow down performance.
   - **Suggestion**: Keep `wbits` at `15` for better compression performance, but consider testing with `8` or `9` to see if it significantly improves speed without a drastic drop in compression efficiency.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory allocated for internal compression state. A lower `memLevel` can lead to faster operations at the cost of compression efficiency.
   - **Suggestion**: Set `memLevel` to `4` or `5`. This strikes a balance between memory usage and computational speed, as higher values lead to more memory consumption and can slow down the process.

4. **strategy**: This defines the compression strategy (with options typically like filtered, Huffman only, etc.). The default strategy is usually fine for general purposes.
   - **Suggestion**: Keep `strategy` at `0`, which is the default strategy and should work effectively for most cases. If you know the type of data being compressed (e.g., text, binary), you can experiment with specific strategies.

### Optimized Parameter Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 1   // or 2 for slightly better compression
wbits := 8   // or maintain 15 for better ratios based on tests
memLevel := 4  // or 5 for a better balance
strategy := 0 // keep default
```

### Summary:
- **level**: 1 or 2 (minimizes compression time)
- **wbits**: 8 (for faster processing, test with 15)
- **memLevel**: 4 or 5 (reduces memory usage)
- **strategy**: 0 (default strategy is usually optimal)

By applying these adjustments, you should see an improvement in runtime performance without significantly compromising the functionality of the compression process.
