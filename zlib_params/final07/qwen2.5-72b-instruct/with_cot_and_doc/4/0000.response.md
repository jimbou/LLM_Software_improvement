### Analysis of Parameters

1. **level**:
   - The current setting is `6`, which provides a balanced trade-off between compression speed and ratio. However, if the primary goal is to optimize runtime performance, reducing the level to `4` or `5` could significantly speed up the compression process at the cost of a slightly lower compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - The current setting is `15`, which is outside the documented range of `25` to `31`. This suggests a potential misconfiguration or a non-standard setting. For optimal performance, we should set `wbits` within the standard range. A value of `28` (the default) would provide a good balance between compression ratio and memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - The current setting is `8`, which allocates a high amount of memory for internal compression state, potentially improving compression speed. However, if memory usage is a concern, reducing this to `6` or `7` might still maintain good performance while using less memory.

4. **strategy**:
   - The current setting is `0`, which is `Z_FILTERED`. This strategy is suitable for data produced by filters or predictors. If the data type is different, changing the strategy might improve performance. For general-purpose data, the default strategy (`4`) is usually the best choice.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Reduce `level`**:
   - Set `level` to `5` to achieve a better balance between compression speed and ratio.
   - **Impact**: Faster compression with a slight decrease in compression ratio.

2. **Set `wbits` within the standard range**:
   - Set `wbits` to `28` to ensure proper configuration and maintain a good balance between compression ratio and memory usage.
   - **Impact**: Improved reliability and potentially better compression ratio.

3. **Adjust `memLevel`**:
   - Set `memLevel` to `7` to reduce memory usage slightly while maintaining good performance.
   - **Impact**: Reduced memory usage with minimal impact on compression speed.

4. **Use the default strategy**:
   - Set `strategy` to `4` (default) unless the data type specifically benefits from another strategy.
   - **Impact**: Better performance for general-purpose data.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **level = 5**: Reduces the compression level to speed up the process while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
- **wbits = 28**: Ensures the window size is within the standard range, balancing compression ratio and memory usage.
- **memLevel = 7**: Reduces memory allocation slightly, which can help in environments with limited memory resources, while still maintaining good performance.
- **strategy = 4**: Uses the default strategy, which is generally the best choice for most types of data, ensuring optimal performance.

These adjustments should improve the runtime performance of the compression process while maintaining a good balance between speed and compression efficiency.
