### Analysis of Parameters

1. **level**: This parameter directly affects the balance between compression speed and compression ratio. Higher levels provide better compression but at the cost of increased processing time.

2. **wbits**: This parameter influences the amount of memory used for the history buffer. Larger values can improve compression ratios but increase memory usage and potentially slow down the process.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory allocated for the compression state. Higher values can lead to faster compression but require more memory.

4. **strategy**: This parameter adjusts the compression algorithm to better suit different types of data. Choosing the right strategy can significantly impact performance.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **level**: Since the current value is `6`, which is a balanced setting, we might consider increasing it slightly to `7` to get a better compression ratio without significantly impacting the speed. However, if the primary concern is speed, reducing it to `5` could be beneficial.

2. **wbits**: The current value is `15`, which is outside the documented range of `25` to `31`. We should set it to a valid value. A value of `28` is a good starting point as it provides a reasonable balance between compression ratio and memory usage.

3. **memLevel**: The current value is `8`, which is already high and allocates a significant amount of memory. If memory usage is a concern, we could reduce it to `6` to save memory while still maintaining good performance.

4. **strategy**: The current value is `0`, which is `Z_FILTERED`. If the data being compressed is not filtered or predicted, changing this to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` (value `4`) could improve performance.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 7
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **level**: Increased from `6` to `7` to achieve a better compression ratio. This will slightly increase the processing time but is generally acceptable for most applications where better compression is desired.

2. **wbits**: Changed from `15` to `28` to bring it within the valid range and to provide a balanced window size that offers good compression without excessive memory usage.

3. **memLevel**: Reduced from `8` to `6` to optimize memory usage. This change will help reduce the memory footprint, which can be crucial in resource-constrained environments.

4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4` to use the default strategy (`Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`). This strategy is generally more versatile and can handle a wider range of data types efficiently.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between compression efficiency, speed, and memory usage, optimizing the overall runtime performance of the compression process.
