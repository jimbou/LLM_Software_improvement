### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, compression ratio, memory usage, and the type of data being compressed. Hereâ€™s an analysis of each parameter:

1. **level**:
   - The current value is `6`, which provides a balanced trade-off between speed and compression ratio. However, if runtime performance is a higher priority, reducing this value could significantly speed up the compression process at the cost of a lower compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - The current value is `15`, which is outside the documented range of `25` to `31`. This suggests a potential error in the configuration. A value of `15` would correspond to a very small window size, which might not be optimal for most data types. Increasing this value to within the recommended range could improve the compression ratio and performance.

3. **memLevel**:
   - The current value is `8`, which is already set to a high memory usage level, indicating a focus on performance. However, if memory usage is a concern, this value could be reduced to balance performance and resource consumption.

4. **strategy**:
   - The current value is `0`, which is the `Z_FILTERED` strategy. This strategy is best suited for data produced by a filter or predictor. If the data does not fit this description, changing the strategy might yield better results. For general-purpose data, the default strategy (`Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`) is often the best choice.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **level**:
   - **Adjustment**: Reduce the level to `4` to prioritize faster compression.
   - **Impact**: This will significantly reduce the compression time but may result in a slightly lower compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Adjustment**: Set `wbits` to `28` to bring it within the recommended range.
   - **Impact**: This will provide a reasonable window size for most data types, improving the compression ratio and performance.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Adjustment**: Keep `memLevel` at `8` if memory usage is not a concern. If memory is limited, consider reducing it to `5`.
   - **Impact**: Keeping it at `8` will maintain high performance, while reducing it to `5` will save memory at the cost of slightly reduced performance.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Adjustment**: Change the strategy to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) unless the data is known to benefit from the `Z_FILTERED` strategy.
   - **Impact**: This will optimize the compression algorithm for general-purpose data, potentially improving both speed and compression ratio.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **level**: Reduced from `6` to `4` to prioritize faster compression, which is beneficial for scenarios where runtime performance is critical.
- **wbits**: Adjusted from `15` to `28` to ensure the window size is appropriate for most data types, improving the compression ratio and performance.
- **memLevel**: Kept at `8` to maintain high performance, assuming memory usage is not a limiting factor.
- **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4` to use the default strategy, which is generally optimal for a wide range of data types.

These adjustments should result in a more efficient and faster compression process while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
