### Analysis of Parameters

1. **level**:
   - The current setting is `6`, which provides a balanced trade-off between compression speed and efficiency. However, if the primary goal is to optimize runtime performance (i.e., faster compression), reducing the level might be beneficial. Conversely, if better compression ratios are needed, increasing the level could be considered.

2. **wbits**:
   - The current setting is `15`, which is outside the documented range (25-31). This suggests a potential error in the configuration. The correct range should be used to ensure proper functionality. A higher value within the range (e.g., `28`) would provide a larger window size, potentially improving compression ratios but at the cost of increased memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - The current setting is `8`, which is relatively high and indicates a preference for using more memory to achieve faster compression. This is generally a good setting for optimizing runtime performance, but it can be adjusted based on available system resources.

4. **strategy**:
   - The current setting is `0`, which is `Z_FILTERED`. This strategy is suitable for data that has been pre-processed by a filter or predictor. If the data being compressed does not fit this profile, changing the strategy could yield better results. For general-purpose data, the default strategy (`4`) might be more appropriate.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **level**:
   - To optimize for runtime performance, reduce the compression level to `4`. This will significantly increase the compression speed while still providing reasonable compression ratios.
   - **New Value**: `4`

2. **wbits**:
   - Correct the out-of-range value to a valid setting. A value of `28` is a good balance between compression ratio and memory usage.
   - **New Value**: `28`

3. **memLevel**:
   - The current setting of `8` is already optimized for performance. However, if memory usage is a concern, it could be reduced to `7` or `6` to balance performance and resource usage.
   - **New Value**: `8` (or `7` if memory is a concern)

4. **strategy**:
   - Change the strategy to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) to use the default settings, which are generally well-suited for a wide range of data types.
   - **New Value**: `4`

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **level**:
   - Reducing the level from `6` to `4` will significantly decrease the compression time, making the process faster. This is particularly useful if the primary goal is to minimize runtime, even at the cost of slightly lower compression ratios.

2. **wbits**:
   - Setting `wbits` to `28` ensures that the window size is within the valid range and provides a good balance between compression ratio and memory usage. This change will help maintain efficient compression while avoiding potential issues with an invalid setting.

3. **memLevel**:
   - Keeping `memLevel` at `8` maintains the focus on performance optimization. If memory usage becomes a concern, it can be reduced to `7` or `6` to free up resources, but this might slightly impact compression speed.

4. **strategy**:
   - Switching to the default strategy (`4`) ensures that the compression algorithm is well-suited for a variety of data types, which is generally a safe and effective choice. This change avoids the potential inefficiencies of using a specialized strategy that might not be optimal for the data being compressed.

By implementing these changes, the configuration should provide a noticeable improvement in runtime performance while maintaining acceptable compression ratios.
