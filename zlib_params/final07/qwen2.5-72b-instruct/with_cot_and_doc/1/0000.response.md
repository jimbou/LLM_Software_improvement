### Analysis of Parameters

1. **level**:
   - The current setting is `6`, which provides a balanced trade-off between compression speed and efficiency. However, if the goal is to optimize for runtime performance (faster compression), reducing this value could be beneficial. Conversely, if the goal is to achieve higher compression ratios, increasing this value might be appropriate.

2. **wbits**:
   - The current setting is `15`, which is outside the documented range of `25` to `31`. This suggests that the value might be incorrect or non-standard. For optimal performance, it should be within the documented range. A higher value within this range (e.g., `28`) would increase the window size, potentially improving compression ratios at the cost of increased memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - The current setting is `8`, which is already quite high and indicates a preference for using more memory to achieve faster compression. This is generally a good setting for performance optimization, but if memory usage is a concern, it could be reduced slightly.

4. **strategy**:
   - The current setting is `0`, which is `Z_FILTERED`. This strategy is typically used for data that has been pre-processed by a filter or predictor. If the data being compressed does not fit this profile, changing the strategy to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` (value `4`) might provide better performance.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **level**:
   - If the primary goal is to reduce runtime, consider lowering the level to `3` or `4`. This will decrease the compression ratio but significantly increase the compression speed.
   - If the primary goal is to improve compression efficiency, consider increasing the level to `8` or `9`. This will slow down the compression process but yield better compression ratios.

2. **wbits**:
   - Adjust the value to `28` to bring it within the documented range. This will provide a reasonable balance between compression efficiency and memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - Keep the value at `8` to maintain fast compression performance. If memory usage is a concern, consider reducing it to `7`.

4. **strategy**:
   - Change the value to `4` (`Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`) unless the data being compressed is known to benefit from the `Z_FILTERED` strategy.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := 28
memLevel := 8
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **level**:
   - **From `6` to `4`**: Reducing the level from `6` to `4` will make the compression process faster, which is beneficial for runtime performance. This is a good choice if the slight reduction in compression ratio is acceptable.

2. **wbits**:
   - **From `15` to `28`**: Bringing the value within the documented range ensures that the window size is appropriate for the compression algorithm. A window size of `28` (which corresponds to `16,384` bytes) provides a good balance between compression efficiency and memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Kept at `8`**: Maintaining a high memLevel ensures that the compression process remains fast by utilizing more memory. This is particularly useful for large datasets where the overhead of memory allocation can be amortized over the compression time.

4. **strategy**:
   - **From `0` to `4`**: Changing the strategy to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` (value `4`) is a safe and generally effective choice for most types of data. It allows the compression algorithm to adapt to the data, potentially improving both speed and compression ratio.

By making these adjustments, the configuration is optimized for better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable balance between compression speed and efficiency.
