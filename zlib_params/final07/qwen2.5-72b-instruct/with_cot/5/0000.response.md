To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, we need to understand what each parameter does and how it affects the compression and decompression process. The parameters you've provided seem to be related to a compression algorithm, possibly zlib or a similar library. Here's a brief explanation of each parameter:

- **level**: Compression level (0-9). Higher values mean better compression but longer compression time.
- **wbits**: Window size in bits (8-15). Larger values use more memory but can achieve better compression.
- **memLevel**: Memory usage level (1-9). Higher values use more memory but can speed up compression.
- **strategy**: Compression strategy (0-4). Different strategies can affect both compression ratio and speed.

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **level (6)**: This is a moderate compression level. Increasing it will improve compression but slow down the process.
2. **wbits ('15')**: This is the maximum window size, which uses the most memory but potentially provides the best compression.
3. **memLevel (8)**: This is a high memory usage level, which can speed up compression but uses more memory.
4. **strategy (0)**: This is the default strategy, which is generally balanced between speed and compression.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce `level`**: If runtime performance is a priority, consider reducing the compression level to 5 or even 4. This will reduce the compression time at the cost of slightly worse compression ratios.
2. **Adjust `wbits`**: If memory usage is a concern, reducing `wbits` to 14 or 13 can help, but this might slightly decrease the compression ratio.
3. **Optimize `memLevel`**: Since `memLevel` is already set to 8, which is quite high, it should be fine unless memory is a critical constraint. If memory is not a concern, you can keep it as is.
4. **Change `strategy`**: Depending on the type of data being compressed, changing the strategy might help. For example, if the data has long repeated sequences, setting `strategy` to 1 (filtered) or 2 (huffman only) might improve performance.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

#### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **level := 5**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 will likely result in a noticeable improvement in runtime performance while still maintaining a good compression ratio.
2. **wbits := '14'**: Reducing the window size from 15 to 14 will decrease memory usage, which can be beneficial if memory is a constraint. This change might slightly reduce the compression ratio but should have a minimal impact on performance.
3. **memLevel := 8**: Keeping the memory level at 8 ensures that the compression process remains fast, as higher memory levels generally speed up the process.
4. **strategy := 1**: Changing the strategy to 1 (filtered) can help if the data contains long repeated sequences. This strategy is designed to handle such data more efficiently, potentially improving both compression speed and ratio.

By making these adjustments, you should see a significant improvement in runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
