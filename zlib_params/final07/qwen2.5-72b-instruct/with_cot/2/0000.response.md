Certainly! Let's analyze the given parameters and optimize them for better runtime performance.

### Original Parameters:
- **level**: 6
- **wbits**: '15'
- **memLevel**: 8
- **strategy**: 0

### Analysis:
1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher values (up to 9) provide better compression but can increase runtime. Level 6 is a good balance between compression and speed, but it might be worth testing lower levels for faster performance.
2. **wbits**: This parameter specifies the size of the window buffer used in the compression algorithm. A value of 15 indicates a 32KB window. Smaller window sizes can reduce memory usage and potentially improve runtime at the cost of compression ratio.
3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for compression. Higher values (up to 9) use more memory but can improve compression speed. A value of 8 is already quite high, but reducing it slightly might help if memory usage is a concern.
4. **strategy**: This parameter determines the compression strategy. The default value of 0 (default strategy) is usually a good choice, but other strategies like 1 (filtered), 2 (huffman only), or 3 (rle) might be more efficient for certain types of data.

### Suggested Adjustments:
1. **Reduce the compression level** to 4 or 5 to see if it significantly improves runtime while maintaining acceptable compression.
2. **Decrease the wbits** value to 14 (16KB window) to reduce memory usage and potentially improve runtime.
3. **Lower the memLevel** to 7 to reduce memory usage without a significant loss in performance.
4. **Consider changing the strategy** to 1 (filtered) if the data has a lot of small, similar sequences, which can benefit from this strategy.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: '14'
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 1

### Explanation of Changes:
- **level = 5**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 should provide a noticeable improvement in runtime while still maintaining a good compression ratio.
- **wbits = '14'**: Decreasing the window size from 32KB to 16KB can reduce memory usage and potentially speed up the compression process, especially for smaller datasets.
- **memLevel = 7**: Lowering the memory level from 8 to 7 reduces the amount of memory used, which can help in environments with limited memory resources.
- **strategy = 1**: Using the filtered strategy can be more efficient for data with repetitive patterns, potentially leading to faster compression times.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 1
```

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of compression. Always test the optimized configuration with your specific data to ensure it meets your requirements.
