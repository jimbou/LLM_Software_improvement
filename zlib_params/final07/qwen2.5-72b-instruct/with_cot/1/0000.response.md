To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, we need to understand their roles and how they affect the compression and decompression processes. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters

1. **level (Compression Level)**
   - **Range**: 0-9
   - **Default**: 6
   - **Impact**: Higher levels provide better compression but increase the compression time. Lower levels compress faster but with less efficiency.

2. **wbits (Window Bits)**
   - **Range**: 9-15
   - **Default**: 15
   - **Impact**: Larger values use more memory but can achieve better compression ratios. Smaller values use less memory but may not compress as effectively.

3. **memLevel (Memory Level)**
   - **Range**: 1-9
   - **Default**: 8
   - **Impact**: Higher values use more memory but can speed up compression. Lower values use less memory but may slow down the process.

4. **strategy (Compression Strategy)**
   - **Range**: 0-4
   - **Default**: 0
   - **Impact**: Different strategies can be used depending on the type of data. The default strategy (0) is generally good for most data types.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **level**
   - **Current**: 6
   - **Optimized**: 4
   - **Reason**: Reducing the level from 6 to 4 will significantly reduce the compression time while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. This is a good balance between performance and efficiency.

2. **wbits**
   - **Current**: 15
   - **Optimized**: 12
   - **Reason**: Reducing wbits from 15 to 12 will decrease memory usage and potentially improve performance, especially in environments with limited memory resources. However, this might slightly reduce the compression ratio.

3. **memLevel**
   - **Current**: 8
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Reason**: Reducing memLevel from 8 to 5 will decrease memory usage and can speed up the compression process. This is a good trade-off for environments where memory is a constraint.

4. **strategy**
   - **Current**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 1
   - **Reason**: Changing the strategy from 0 to 1 (filtered) can improve performance for data with repetitive patterns, such as text or binary files. This strategy is often faster and can provide better results for certain types of data.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '12'
memLevel := 5
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reducing `level` from 6 to 4**: This change reduces the compression time significantly while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. It is a good balance for most applications where performance is a priority.
- **Reducing `wbits` from 15 to 12**: This change decreases memory usage and can improve performance, especially in resource-constrained environments. The slight reduction in compression ratio is often acceptable for the gain in performance.
- **Reducing `memLevel` from 8 to 5**: This change further reduces memory usage and can speed up the compression process. It is particularly beneficial in scenarios where memory is limited.
- **Changing `strategy` from 0 to 1**: Using the filtered strategy can improve performance for data with repetitive patterns, such as text or binary files. This strategy is often faster and can provide better results for certain types of data.

By making these adjustments, the overall runtime performance should improve, making the compression process faster and more efficient, especially in resource-constrained environments.
