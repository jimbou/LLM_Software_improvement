To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance, we need to understand the role of each parameter and how it affects the compression process. The parameters provided are typically used in the context of compression algorithms, such as those implemented in the zlib library. Here's a brief overview of each parameter:

1. **level**: Compression level, ranging from 0 (no compression) to 9 (best compression). Higher levels generally result in better compression but at the cost of increased processing time.
2. **wbits**: Window size, which is the base-2 logarithm of the maximum match distance. It can range from 9 to 15. Larger values allow for better compression but use more memory.
3. **memLevel**: Memory usage level, ranging from 1 to 9. Higher values use more memory but can compress faster and better.
4. **strategy**: Compression strategy, which can be one of several predefined values (0 to 4). Different strategies are suited for different types of data.

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

- **level = 6**: This is a moderate compression level, balancing between compression ratio and speed.
- **wbits = '15'**: This is the maximum window size, which allows for the best possible compression but uses the most memory.
- **memLevel = 8**: This is a high memory usage level, which can improve compression speed and ratio.
- **strategy = 0**: This is the default strategy, which is suitable for general-purpose data.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Reduce wbits**: Since `wbits` is set to the maximum value, reducing it slightly can decrease memory usage without significantly impacting compression quality. A value of 14 is often a good balance.
2. **Adjust memLevel**: The current `memLevel` is already quite high. Reducing it slightly to 7 can still provide good performance while using less memory.
3. **Optimize strategy**: For general-purpose data, the default strategy (0) is usually fine. However, if you know the type of data being compressed, you might consider a different strategy. For example, strategy 1 (filtered) is better for data with many small, similar sequences.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

#### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 6
wbits := 14
memLevel := 7
strategy := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **wbits = 14**: By reducing the window size from 15 to 14, we reduce the memory footprint of the compression process. This can lead to faster execution on systems with limited memory, while still maintaining a high compression ratio.
2. **memLevel = 7**: Lowering the memory usage level from 8 to 7 reduces the amount of memory required for the compression process. This can help in environments where memory is a constraint, and it can also slightly improve the speed of the compression process.
3. **strategy = 0**: The strategy remains unchanged because the default strategy is generally well-suited for a wide range of data types. If you have specific knowledge about the data, you might consider adjusting this parameter further.

These changes should help in achieving a better balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.
