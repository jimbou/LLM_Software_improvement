To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: `5`
- **wbits**: `27`
- **memLevel**: `6`
- **strategy**: `4`

### Rationale:
1. **level**: Reduced from `6` to `5`.
   - **Reason**: A slight reduction in the compression level can significantly improve compression speed with minimal impact on the compression ratio. Level `5` still provides a good balance between speed and efficiency.

2. **wbits**: Increased from `15` to `27`.
   - **Reason**: The original value of `15` is outside the valid range (25-31). A value of `27` provides a reasonable window size (`2^(27-16) = 8,192`) that balances compression ratio and memory usage.

3. **memLevel**: Increased from `8` to `6`.
   - **Reason**: While a higher `memLevel` can improve compression speed, it also increases memory usage. Reducing it to `6` still allows for efficient compression while using less memory, which can be beneficial in resource-constrained environments.

4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4`.
   - **Reason**: The default strategy (`4` or `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`) is generally the best choice for most types of data. It optimizes the compression algorithm for typical data patterns, which can lead to better performance and compression ratios compared to specialized strategies like `Z_FILTERED`.

### Summary:
- **level**: `5` (Balanced speed and compression)
- **wbits**: `27` (Reasonable window size for most use cases)
- **memLevel**: `6` (Balanced memory usage and performance)
- **strategy**: `4` (Optimized for general data)

These adjustments should help improve runtime performance while maintaining a good compression ratio and avoiding excessive memory usage.
