To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: 27
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 3

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Reduced from 6 to 5.
   - **Reason**: Level 5 still provides a good balance between compression speed and ratio, but it will generally be faster than level 6. This change can help reduce the compression time without significantly impacting the compression ratio.

2. **wbits**: Changed from '15' to 27.
   - **Reason**: The original value of '15' is outside the valid range (25-31). Setting it to 27 provides a reasonable window size (2^11 = 2048) that balances between memory usage and compression efficiency. A larger window size can improve the compression ratio, but it also increases memory usage. 27 is a good compromise.

3. **memLevel**: Increased from 8 to 7.
   - **Reason**: MemLevel 8 allocates a lot of memory, which might not be necessary for all use cases. Reducing it to 7 can still provide good performance while using less memory, which can be beneficial in environments with limited resources.

4. **strategy**: Kept at 3.
   - **Reason**: Strategy 3 (Z_FIXED) prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, which can be useful for certain types of data. However, if you are dealing with normal data, you might consider changing this to 4 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) for a more general-purpose approach. For now, keeping it at 3 maintains the current strategy.

### Final Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := 27
memLevel := 7
strategy := 3
```

This configuration should provide a good balance between runtime performance and compression efficiency, while ensuring that the system does not consume excessive memory. If you have specific requirements or data characteristics, further adjustments might be necessary.
