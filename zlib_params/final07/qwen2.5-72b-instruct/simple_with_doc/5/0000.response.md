To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to balance the trade-offs between compression speed, compression ratio, and memory usage. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: 28
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 4

### Rationale:
1. **level**: Reduced from 6 to 5.
   - **Reason**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 can slightly decrease the compression ratio but significantly improve the compression speed. This is a good trade-off if runtime performance is a priority.

2. **wbits**: Set to 28.
   - **Reason**: The default value of 28 provides a good balance between compression ratio and memory usage. Increasing it further would require more memory and might not provide a significant improvement in compression ratio.

3. **memLevel**: Increased from 8 to 7.
   - **Reason**: Setting `memLevel` to 7 reduces memory usage slightly compared to 8, which can help in environments with limited memory resources. This change should still maintain good performance.

4. **strategy**: Set to 4 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY).
   - **Reason**: Using the default strategy (4) is generally the best choice for most types of data, as it allows the compression algorithm to adapt to the data characteristics. This ensures that the compression remains effective without unnecessary overhead.

### Summary:
- **level**: 5 (Balanced compression speed and ratio)
- **wbits**: 28 (Balanced window size)
- **memLevel**: 7 (Balanced memory usage)
- **strategy**: 4 (Default strategy for general data)

This configuration should provide a good balance between runtime performance and compression efficiency, suitable for most use cases.
