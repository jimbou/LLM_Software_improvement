To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: 28
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 3

### Rationale:
1. **level**: 
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Reason**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 will slightly decrease the compression ratio but significantly increase the compression speed. This is a good trade-off if runtime performance is a higher priority than achieving the maximum compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 28
   - **Reason**: The original value of 15 is outside the valid range (25 to 31). Setting it to 28, which is the default value, ensures that the window size is appropriate for most use cases. A larger window size can improve compression ratio without excessively increasing memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 7
   - **Reason**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 7 will slightly reduce memory usage while still maintaining good compression speed. This is a balanced approach to ensure that the system does not run out of memory while still achieving fast compression.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 3
   - **Reason**: The strategy value of 0 (Z_FILTERED) is typically used for data produced by filters or predictors. However, if the data is not specifically filtered, using the default strategy (3, Z_FIXED) can provide a more balanced approach. Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, which can sometimes improve performance for certain types of data.

By making these adjustments, the configuration should offer improved runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and memory usage.
