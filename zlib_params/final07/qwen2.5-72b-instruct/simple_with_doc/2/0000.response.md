To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, compression ratio, and memory usage. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 4
- **wbits**: 18
- **memLevel**: 6
- **strategy**: 3

### Rationale:
1. **level**:
   - **Original**: 6
   - **Optimized**: 4
   - **Reason**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 will increase the compression speed while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. This is a good balance if you need faster compression and can tolerate slightly less efficient compression.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Original**: 15
   - **Optimized**: 18
   - **Reason**: The original value of 15 is outside the valid range (25-31). Adjusting it to 18 provides a moderate window size that balances between memory usage and compression efficiency. A window size of 18 corresponds to a buffer size of 4,096, which is a reasonable compromise.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Original**: 8
   - **Optimized**: 6
   - **Reason**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 6 will reduce memory usage while still providing good performance. This is particularly useful if you are running on a system with limited memory resources.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Original**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 3
   - **Reason**: The strategy value of 3 (`Z_FIXED`) prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, which can sometimes speed up the compression process, especially for data that does not benefit much from dynamic code optimization. This is a safe choice that can improve performance without significantly affecting the compression ratio.

### Summary:
By adjusting these parameters, we aim to achieve a better balance between compression speed, memory usage, and compression efficiency. The optimized settings should provide improved runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality.
