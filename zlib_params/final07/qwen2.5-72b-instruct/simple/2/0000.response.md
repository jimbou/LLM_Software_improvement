To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency in a compression context (assuming these parameters are related to a compression algorithm like Zstandard or similar), we can adjust them to balance between compression ratio and speed. Here's a brief explanation of each parameter and how it affects performance:

- **level**: This controls the compression level. Higher values mean better compression but longer compression times.
- **wbits**: This typically controls the window size. A larger window size can improve compression but requires more memory and can slow down the process.
- **memLevel**: This controls the amount of memory used during compression. Higher values use more memory but can speed up the process.
- **strategy**: This determines the compression strategy. Different strategies can be more efficient depending on the type of data being compressed.

For optimizing runtime efficiency, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **Reduce `level`**: Lowering the compression level will reduce the time spent on compression, at the cost of a slightly lower compression ratio.
2. **Adjust `wbits`**: Reducing the window size can decrease memory usage and speed up the process, especially for smaller datasets.
3. **Optimize `memLevel`**: Adjusting the memory level can help balance between memory usage and speed.
4. **Choose an appropriate `strategy`**: Select a strategy that is known to be fast for the type of data you are compressing.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3 (reduced from 6 to balance between compression ratio and speed)
- **wbits**: '12' (reduced from '15' to decrease memory usage and improve speed)
- **memLevel**: 5 (reduced from 8 to balance memory usage and speed)
- **strategy**: 1 (use a faster strategy, such as `ZSTD_fast` for Zstandard)

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 3
wbits := '12'
memLevel := 5
strategy := 1
```

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. Always test the optimized settings with your specific data to ensure they meet your requirements.
