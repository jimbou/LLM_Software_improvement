To optimize the given parameters for the best runtime performance, we need to consider how each parameter affects the compression process. Here's a brief overview of what each parameter does:

- **level**: Controls the compression level. Higher values mean better compression but longer processing time.
- **wbits**: Window size in bits. Affects memory usage and compression ratio.
- **memLevel**: Memory usage level. Higher values use more memory but can improve compression speed.
- **strategy**: Compression strategy. Different strategies can be more efficient depending on the data type.

Given the current parameters:
- **level = 6**: This is a moderate compression level, balancing between compression ratio and speed.
- **wbits = '15'**: This is a reasonable window size, but it might be too large for some applications.
- **memLevel = 8**: This is the highest memory usage level, which can speed up compression but uses more memory.
- **strategy = 0**: Default strategy, which is usually a good starting point.

To optimize for runtime performance, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **Reduce `level`**: Lowering the compression level can significantly reduce the processing time. A value of 3 or 4 might be a good compromise.
2. **Reduce `wbits`**: A smaller window size can reduce memory usage and speed up the process. A value of 12 or 13 might be more efficient.
3. **Adjust `memLevel`**: If memory usage is not a concern, keeping it at 8 is fine. However, if you want to reduce memory usage, you can lower it to 7 or 6.
4. **Consider different `strategy`**: Depending on the data, a different strategy might be more efficient. For example, strategy 1 (filtered) or 2 (huffman only) might be faster for certain types of data.

Here are the optimized parameters for the best runtime performance:

```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '13'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation:
- **level = 4**: Reduces the compression level to speed up the process while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
- **wbits = '13'**: Reduces the window size to lower memory usage and speed up the process.
- **memLevel = 7**: Slightly reduces memory usage while still maintaining good performance.
- **strategy = 1**: Uses the filtered strategy, which can be faster for certain types of data.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of your compression process.
