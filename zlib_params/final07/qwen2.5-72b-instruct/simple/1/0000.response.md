To optimize the given parameters for the best runtime performance, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression level, memory usage, and speed. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each parameter:

- **level**: This controls the compression level. Higher values provide better compression but take more time.
- **wbits**: This is the window size in bits. A larger value can improve compression but may increase memory usage and processing time.
- **memLevel**: This controls the amount of memory used during compression. Higher values use more memory but can be faster.
- **strategy**: This specifies the compression strategy. Different strategies can affect both compression ratio and speed.

For optimizing runtime performance, we generally want to reduce the compression level and memory usage while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. Here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3 (Reduced from 6 to balance between compression and speed)
- **wbits**: '14' (Reduced from 15 to slightly decrease memory usage and speed up processing)
- **memLevel**: 4 (Reduced from 8 to lower memory usage, which can improve speed on systems with limited memory)
- **strategy**: 1 (Changed from 0 to 1, which is a more balanced strategy that often provides good performance)

### Explanation:
- **level = 3**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 3 will significantly speed up the compression process while still providing a reasonable compression ratio.
- **wbits = '14'**: Slightly reducing the window size from 15 to 14 can help reduce memory usage and improve speed without a significant loss in compression quality.
- **memLevel = 4**: Lowering the memory level from 8 to 4 reduces the memory footprint, which can be beneficial on systems with limited resources and can also improve speed due to less memory overhead.
- **strategy = 1**: Changing the strategy from 0 (default) to 1 (filtered) can provide a better balance between compression and speed, especially for data that has some structure or patterns.

These changes should help achieve better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of compression.
