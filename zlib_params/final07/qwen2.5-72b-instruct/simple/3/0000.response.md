To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression level, memory usage, and speed. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each parameter and how it can be adjusted:

1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher values result in better compression but longer processing time. For runtime efficiency, you might want to reduce this value.
2. **wbits**: This parameter affects the size of the history buffer used during compression. A smaller value can reduce memory usage and potentially improve speed, but may also reduce compression efficiency.
3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for compression. Lower values use less memory but may slow down the process.
4. **strategy**: This parameter specifies the compression strategy. Different strategies can affect both compression ratio and speed. The default value (0) is usually a good balance, but other values might be more suitable depending on the data.

Given these considerations, here are the optimized parameters for the best runtime performance:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3 (Reducing from 6 to 3 should significantly improve runtime while still providing reasonable compression.)
- **wbits**: '12' (Reducing from '15' to '12' can help reduce memory usage and improve speed.)
- **memLevel**: 5 (Reducing from 8 to 5 will use less memory and potentially improve speed.)
- **strategy**: 1 (Using strategy 1, which is filtered, can be faster for certain types of data.)

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 3
wbits := '12'
memLevel := 5
strategy := 1
```

These adjustments should help achieve better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of compression. Always test the optimized settings with your specific data to ensure they meet your requirements.
