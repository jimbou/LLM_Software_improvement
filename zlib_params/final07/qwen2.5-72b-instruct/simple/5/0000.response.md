To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression ratio and speed. The parameters you've provided seem to be related to a compression algorithm, possibly Zstandard (zstd). Here's a brief explanation of each parameter:

- **level**: Compression level, where higher values mean better compression but slower speed.
- **wbits**: Window size in bits. Larger values can improve compression but increase memory usage and potentially slow down the process.
- **memLevel**: Memory usage level. Higher values use more memory but can improve compression speed.
- **strategy**: Compression strategy. Different strategies can affect both compression ratio and speed.

For optimizing runtime efficiency, we generally want to reduce the compression level and window size while maintaining an acceptable compression ratio. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3 (Reducing from 6 to 3 will significantly speed up the compression process while still providing good compression.)
- **wbits**: '14' (Reducing from 15 to 14 will decrease memory usage and potentially speed up the process.)
- **memLevel**: 5 (Reducing from 8 to 5 will lower memory usage and improve speed.)
- **strategy**: 1 (Using a faster strategy, such as `fast` or `lazy`, can improve runtime performance.)

### Final Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 3
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 5
strategy := 1
```

These changes should help achieve better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
