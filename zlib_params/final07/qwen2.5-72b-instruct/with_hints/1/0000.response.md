To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, let's analyze each parameter and suggest improvements:

### Original Parameters:
- `level := 6`
- `wbits := '15'`
- `memLevel := 8`
- `strategy := 0`

### Analysis and Optimization:

1. **`level`**:
   - **Description**: The compression level, where higher values mean better compression but longer compression time.
   - **Optimization**: A value of 6 is a good balance between compression ratio and speed. However, if runtime performance is a critical concern, you might consider reducing this value slightly to 4 or 5, which will still provide reasonable compression but with faster processing times.
   - **Suggested Value**: `level := 5`

2. **`wbits`**:
   - **Description**: The window size used in the compression algorithm. Higher values use more memory but can achieve better compression.
   - **Optimization**: A value of 15 (which corresponds to a window size of 32KB) is already quite efficient. Reducing it further might not significantly improve performance but could slightly reduce memory usage. However, if you need to maintain good compression, keep it at 15.
   - **Suggested Value**: `wbits := '15'` (no change)

3. **`memLevel`**:
   - **Description**: The amount of memory used for compression. Higher values use more memory but can speed up the process.
   - **Optimization**: A value of 8 is the highest setting and uses the most memory. If memory usage is a concern, you can reduce this value to 7 or 6, which should still provide good performance but with less memory usage.
   - **Suggested Value**: `memLevel := 7`

4. **`strategy`**:
   - **Description**: The compression strategy, where 0 is the default and generally provides a good balance between speed and compression.
   - **Optimization**: The default value of 0 is usually optimal. Changing this value might not provide significant benefits unless you have specific requirements for the type of data being compressed.
   - **Suggested Value**: `strategy := 0` (no change)

### Optimized Parameters:
- `level := 5`
- `wbits := '15'`
- `memLevel := 7`
- `strategy := 0`

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining a good balance of compression efficiency and memory usage.
