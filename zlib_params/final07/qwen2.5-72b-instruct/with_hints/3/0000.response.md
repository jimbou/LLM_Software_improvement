To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand what each parameter does and how it affects performance. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher levels provide better compression but can increase processing time.
2. **wbits**: This parameter sets the size of the window buffer used in the compression process. A larger value can improve compression ratio but may also increase memory usage and processing time.
3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for internal compression state. Higher values can speed up compression at the cost of increased memory usage.
4. **strategy**: This parameter determines the compression strategy. Different strategies can be more effective for different types of data.

Given these parameters, here are the optimized values:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 4
- **wbits**: '14'
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 1

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 can significantly reduce the processing time while still providing a good balance between compression ratio and speed.
2. **wbits**: Decreasing the window buffer size from 15 to 14 can reduce memory usage and potentially speed up the compression process, especially for smaller datasets.
3. **memLevel**: Lowering the memory level from 8 to 7 reduces the memory footprint slightly, which can help in environments with limited memory resources, without a significant impact on performance.
4. **strategy**: Changing the strategy from 0 (default) to 1 (filtered) can improve compression performance for certain types of data, particularly those with repetitive patterns or small variations.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and system functionality.
