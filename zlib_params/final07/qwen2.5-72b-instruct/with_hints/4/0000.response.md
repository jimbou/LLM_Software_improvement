To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand what each parameter controls and how it affects the compression process. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each parameter and its typical impact on performance:

1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher levels provide better compression but can significantly increase the runtime.
2. **wbits**: This parameter sets the size of the sliding window used in the compression algorithm. A larger window can improve compression but may also increase memory usage and runtime.
3. **memLevel**: This parameter determines the amount of memory used by the compression algorithm. Higher values use more memory but can speed up the compression process.
4. **strategy**: This parameter specifies the compression strategy. Different strategies can affect both the compression ratio and the runtime.

### Current Configuration:
- `level := 6`
- `wbits := '15'`
- `memLevel := 8`
- `strategy := 0`

### Analysis:
- **level = 6**: This is a moderate compression level. Reducing this value can significantly decrease runtime at the cost of some compression efficiency.
- **wbits = '15'**: This is a relatively large window size, which can increase memory usage and runtime. Reducing this value can help.
- **memLevel = 8**: This is the highest memory level, which can speed up the process but uses more memory. Lowering this value can reduce memory usage and potentially runtime.
- **strategy = 0**: This is the default strategy (filtered), which is generally balanced. Changing this might not have a significant impact unless specific data characteristics are known.

### Optimized Configuration:
To balance performance and compression efficiency, we can adjust the parameters as follows:

- **level**: Reduce from 6 to 3 or 4. This will significantly reduce runtime while still providing reasonable compression.
- **wbits**: Reduce from 15 to 12 or 13. This will reduce memory usage and runtime with a minor impact on compression.
- **memLevel**: Reduce from 8 to 6 or 7. This will reduce memory usage and potentially runtime without a significant loss in performance.
- **strategy**: Keep at 0 unless specific data characteristics suggest otherwise.

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '13'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 0
```

### Explanation:
- **level = 4**: This provides a good balance between compression and runtime.
- **wbits = '13'**: Reduces memory usage and runtime while maintaining acceptable compression.
- **memLevel = 7**: Balances memory usage and performance.
- **strategy = 0**: Maintains the default strategy, which is generally effective for most data types.

These changes should help reduce the runtime while keeping the system functional and reasonably efficient in terms of compression.
