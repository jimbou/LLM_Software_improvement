To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand the role of each parameter in the context of the compression algorithm (likely a variant of the DEFLATE algorithm used in zlib). Hereâ€™s a breakdown and suggested optimization:

### Original Parameters:
- **level**: 6
- **wbits**: '15'
- **memLevel**: 8
- **strategy**: 0

### Parameter Analysis:
1. **level**:
   - This parameter controls the compression level. Higher values (1-9) provide better compression but at the cost of increased CPU usage and potentially longer runtime.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the level can significantly decrease runtime at the expense of slightly less compression. A value of 4 or 5 is often a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

2. **wbits**:
   - This parameter specifies the window size in bits. A value of 15 corresponds to a 32KB window size, which is the maximum for DEFLATE.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing wbits can decrease memory usage and potentially improve performance, especially for smaller files. However, it might also reduce compression efficiency. A value of 14 (16KB window) could be a reasonable compromise.

3. **memLevel**:
   - This parameter controls the amount of memory used for internal compression state. Higher values use more memory but can improve compression speed.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing memLevel can save memory and potentially speed up the process, especially on systems with limited memory. A value of 7 or 6 is often sufficient.

4. **strategy**:
   - This parameter specifies the compression strategy. The default value of 0 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) is usually the best choice for general data.
   - **Optimization**: Changing this value might not have a significant impact on performance unless you have specific types of data that benefit from different strategies. For most cases, keeping it at 0 is recommended.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: '14'
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 0

### Explanation:
- **level**: Reduced from 6 to 5 to balance compression and runtime performance.
- **wbits**: Reduced from 15 to 14 to decrease memory usage and potentially improve performance for smaller files.
- **memLevel**: Reduced from 8 to 7 to save memory and potentially speed up the process.
- **strategy**: Kept at 0 as it is generally the best default strategy for most data types.

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining a good level of compression and system functionality.
