To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand what each parameter controls and how it impacts performance. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher levels mean better compression but longer processing time.
- **wbits**: This parameter sets the size of the sliding window used in the compression algorithm. A larger window can improve compression but may increase memory usage and processing time.
- **memLevel**: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for internal compression state. Higher values use more memory but can speed up compression.
- **strategy**: This parameter determines the compression strategy. Different strategies can be more effective for different types of data.

### Analysis and Optimization:

1. **level**:
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the level can significantly decrease runtime at the cost of slightly less compression. A value of 3 or 4 is often a good balance between compression and speed.
   - **Suggested Value**: 4

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimization**: The value 15 indicates a window size of \(2^{15} = 32768\) bytes. Reducing this can decrease memory usage and speed up processing, especially for smaller files.
   - **Suggested Value**: 14 (window size of 16384 bytes)

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimization**: A higher memLevel uses more memory but can speed up compression. However, if memory is not a limiting factor, keeping it high can help. If memory is a concern, reducing it slightly might help.
   - **Suggested Value**: 7 (a slight reduction to balance memory usage and speed)

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimization**: The default strategy (0) is usually a good choice, but for specific types of data, other strategies might be more efficient. For general-purpose compression, the default is often optimal.
   - **Suggested Value**: 0 (keep as is unless you have specific data characteristics)

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 0
```

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining a reasonable level of compression and functionality.
