To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their impact on performance and resource usage. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := 15
memLevel := 6
strategy := 0
```

### Rationale:

1. **level**:
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 4
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 will significantly increase the compression speed while still providing a reasonable compression ratio. This is particularly useful if the system needs to handle a high volume of data quickly.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 15
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 15 is already set to the minimum allowed value, which is optimal for reducing memory usage and improving performance. Keeping it at 15 ensures that the window size remains small, which is beneficial for runtime performance.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 6
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 6 will decrease the amount of memory used for internal compression state, which can help in environments with limited memory resources. This reduction in memory usage can also lead to better cache utilization and potentially faster performance.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: The current strategy value of 0 (Z_FILTERED) is appropriate for data produced by a filter or predictor. This strategy is generally efficient and does not need to be changed unless you have specific data characteristics that would benefit from a different strategy. However, if the data is known to be highly repetitive or has specific patterns, you might consider testing other strategies like Z_RLE (2) or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY (1).

### Summary:
- **level**: Reduced from 6 to 4 to improve compression speed.
- **wbits**: Kept at 15 to maintain low memory usage and fast performance.
- **memLevel**: Reduced from 8 to 6 to further optimize memory usage.
- **strategy**: Kept at 0 (Z_FILTERED) to maintain the current strategy, which is suitable for filtered or predicted data.

These changes should result in a more efficient and faster runtime performance while maintaining the necessary compression quality and system functionality.
