To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Based on the provided documentation, here are the optimized parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := 15
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4
```

### Rationale:

1. **level**:
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 will slightly decrease the compression ratio but significantly increase the compression speed. This is a good trade-off if runtime performance is a priority.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 15
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 15 is already set to the minimum allowed value, which provides a smaller window size and thus reduces memory usage and potentially improves performance. No change is needed here.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 6
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 6 will decrease the amount of memory allocated for internal compression state, which can help reduce memory overhead and potentially improve performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 4
   - **Rationale**: Changing the strategy from `0` (Z_FILTERED) to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) will use the default strategy, which is generally optimized for normal data. This can provide a better balance between compression efficiency and performance.

### Summary:
By adjusting the `level` to 5, reducing the `memLevel` to 6, and setting the `strategy` to 4, we aim to achieve a better balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance. These changes should help reduce the overall runtime while maintaining acceptable compression ratios and memory usage.
