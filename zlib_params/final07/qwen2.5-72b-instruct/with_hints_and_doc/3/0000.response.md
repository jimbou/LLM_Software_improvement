To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 4
- **wbits**: 15
- **memLevel**: 5
- **strategy**: 4

### Explanation:

1. **level**: 
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 4
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 will decrease the compression time, as higher levels (like 6 and 9) are more computationally intensive. Level 4 still provides a reasonable balance between compression speed and ratio, making it a good choice for reducing runtime without significantly compromising the compression efficiency.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 15
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 15 is already set to the minimum allowed value, which corresponds to a window size of 32 KB. This is a good starting point for balancing memory usage and compression ratio. Since reducing it further is not possible, we keep it at 15 to maintain the current memory footprint and performance.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 8 allocates a lot of memory for the internal compression state, which can improve compression speed but also increases memory usage. By setting it to 5, we achieve a balanced approach that reduces memory usage while still maintaining good performance. This is particularly useful if you are constrained by available memory.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 4
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 0 (Z_FILTERED) is typically used for data produced by filters or predictors, which might not be the case for general data. Setting the strategy to 4 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) is a safer and more versatile choice for typical data, as it uses the default strategy optimized for normal data. This should provide a good balance between compression efficiency and speed.

### Summary:
- **level**: 4 (reduced from 6 to speed up compression)
- **wbits**: 15 (kept the same to maintain memory efficiency)
- **memLevel**: 5 (reduced from 8 to save memory)
- **strategy**: 4 (changed from 0 to a more general-purpose strategy)

These changes should help reduce the runtime while keeping the system functional and efficient.
