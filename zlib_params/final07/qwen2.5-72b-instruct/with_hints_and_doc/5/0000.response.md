To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: 15
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 0

### Rationale:
1. **level**:
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Reason**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 will slightly decrease the compression ratio but significantly improve the compression speed. This is a good trade-off if runtime performance is a higher priority than achieving the maximum compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 15
   - **Reason**: The current value of 15 is already set to the minimum allowed value, which reduces the window size and, consequently, the memory usage. This is beneficial for reducing runtime and memory consumption without significantly impacting the compression ratio.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 7
   - **Reason**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 7 will slightly decrease the memory usage, which can help in environments with limited memory resources. This change should still maintain good performance while reducing the memory footprint.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Reason**: The current strategy value of 0 (Z_FILTERED) is appropriate for data produced by a filter or predictor. If your data fits this description, keeping this value is optimal. However, if you are dealing with general data, you might consider using the default strategy (4) for a more balanced approach.

### Summary:
- **level**: Reduced from 6 to 5 to improve compression speed.
- **wbits**: Kept at 15 to minimize memory usage.
- **memLevel**: Reduced from 8 to 7 to further reduce memory usage.
- **strategy**: Kept at 0 to maintain the current compression strategy, assuming it is suitable for your data type.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and memory usage. If you find that the performance is still not satisfactory, you can further experiment with different combinations, especially by adjusting the `level` and `memLevel` parameters.
