To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their impact on performance and resource usage. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 4
- **wbits**: 15
- **memLevel**: 5
- **strategy**: 0

### Rationale:

1. **level**:
   - **Current Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 4
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 will significantly increase the compression speed, although it will slightly decrease the compression ratio. This is a good trade-off if runtime performance is more critical than achieving the highest possible compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - **Current Value**: 15
   - **Optimized Value**: 15
   - **Rationale**: The current value of 15 is already at the lower end of the range, which means it uses a smaller window size and thus less memory. This is beneficial for reducing memory usage and improving performance. Keeping it at 15 maintains the balance between memory usage and compression efficiency.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **Current Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the memory level from 8 to 5 will decrease the amount of memory used for internal compression state, which can help reduce the overhead and improve runtime performance. The default value of 5 is a balanced choice that offers good performance without excessive memory usage.

4. **strategy**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: The strategy is currently set to 0, which is **Z_FILTERED**. This is a good choice for data produced by a filter or predictor, as it can improve the compression ratio for such data. If the data being compressed is indeed filtered or predicted, keeping this value at 0 is appropriate. If the data type is different, you might consider experimenting with other strategies, but for now, maintaining it at 0 is safe.

### Summary:
By adjusting the `level` to 4, `wbits` to 15, and `memLevel` to 5, we have optimized the configuration to reduce runtime while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and memory usage. The `strategy` remains at 0, assuming the data is suitable for this setting. These changes should result in improved performance without significantly compromising the functionality of the system.
