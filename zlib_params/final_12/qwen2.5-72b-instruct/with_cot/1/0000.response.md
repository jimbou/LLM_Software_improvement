```plaintext
level := 9
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 9
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Increasing the compression level from 6 to 9 can significantly reduce the output size, but it also increases the CPU usage and compression time. This trade-off is beneficial if you have spare CPU resources and need to maximize the compression ratio, thus reducing storage and transmission costs.

2. **wbits**: The `wbits` parameter is set to 15, which is a good default value for standard gzip compression. No change is needed here as it already balances between memory usage and compression efficiency.

3. **memLevel**: Increasing the memory level from 8 to 9 allows the compressor to use more memory, which can lead to better compression ratios, especially for large files. However, this will increase memory usage, so ensure that your system has sufficient RAM to handle the increased load.

4. **strategy**: Changing the strategy from 0 (default) to 1 (filtered) can improve the compression ratio for data with repeating patterns, such as text or source code. The filtered strategy is designed to handle data with a lot of repeated sequences, which can often result in better compression.

These changes should help improve the overall runtime performance by optimizing the balance between compression ratio, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
