level := 4
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Level**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 can significantly decrease the runtime while still maintaining a good balance between compression ratio and speed. Higher levels increase the time taken for compression due to more complex algorithms being used.

2. **wbits**: Lowering `wbits` from 15 to 14 reduces the size of the sliding window used in the compression algorithm. This can lead to faster compression times, especially for smaller data sets, as less memory is required for the window buffer.

3. **memLevel**: Decreasing `memLevel` from 8 to 7 reduces the amount of memory used for internal compression buffers. This can help reduce memory overhead and potentially speed up the process, particularly on systems with limited RAM.

4. **Strategy**: Changing `strategy` from 0 (default) to 1 (filtered) can improve performance for certain types of data. The filtered strategy is designed to handle data with a lot of repetitive sequences, which can often be compressed more efficiently and quickly.

These adjustments aim to strike a better balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance, making the overall process faster and more resource-efficient.
