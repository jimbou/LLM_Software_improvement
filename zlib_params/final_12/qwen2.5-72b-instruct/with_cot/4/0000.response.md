level := 4
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Level**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 can significantly decrease the runtime, as higher levels increase compression but at the cost of increased processing time. Level 4 provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

2. **wbits**: Decreasing `wbits` from 15 to 14 reduces the window size, which can lead to faster compression times. A smaller window size means less data is considered for each compression decision, reducing the computational load.

3. **memLevel**: Lowering `memLevel` from 8 to 7 reduces memory usage, which can also speed up the process. This is particularly beneficial if the system has limited memory resources.

4. **Strategy**: Changing `strategy` from 0 (default) to 1 (filtered) can help in scenarios where the input data has some regularity or structure. The filtered strategy is designed to handle such data more efficiently, potentially leading to better performance.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance, optimizing the configuration for faster execution while maintaining acceptable compression ratios.
