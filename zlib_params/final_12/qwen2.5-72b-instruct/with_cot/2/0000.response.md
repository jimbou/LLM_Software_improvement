level := 9
wbits := '16'
memLevel := 9
strategy := 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Level**: Increasing the compression level from 6 to 9 can significantly improve the compression ratio, but it will also increase the CPU usage and potentially the compression time. However, if the goal is to optimize for better compression (assuming storage space is a critical factor), this adjustment is beneficial.

2. **wbits**: Changing `wbits` from '15' to '16' increases the window size used for compression. A larger window size can lead to better compression ratios, especially for larger files, as it allows the algorithm to find more repeated patterns over a longer distance.

3. **memLevel**: Raising `memLevel` from 8 to 9 increases the amount of memory used during compression. This can further improve compression efficiency by allowing the algorithm to use more sophisticated methods, which can be particularly useful for large datasets or complex data structures.

4. **Strategy**: Setting `strategy` to 1 (filtered) instead of 0 (default) can be advantageous for data with repetitive patterns or structured content. The filtered strategy is designed to handle such data more effectively, potentially leading to better compression ratios and performance.

These adjustments are aimed at optimizing the compression process for better performance, especially in terms of compression ratio and handling large or complex datasets. However, they come with the trade-off of increased CPU usage and possibly longer compression times. If runtime performance is more critical than compression ratio, you might need to find a balance between these parameters.
