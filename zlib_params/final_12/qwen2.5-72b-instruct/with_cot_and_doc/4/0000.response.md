### Explanation of Changes:

1. **level**:
   - **From 6 to 4**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 4 will increase the compression speed at the cost of a slightly lower compression ratio. This adjustment is beneficial if runtime performance is a higher priority than achieving the highest possible compression ratio.

2. **wbits**:
   - **From 15 to 29**: Increasing the window size from 15 to 29 will provide a larger history buffer, which can improve the compression ratio by allowing more efficient matching of longer patterns. However, this comes with increased memory usage. Given that the original value was set to 15, which is quite low, increasing it to 29 balances better compression with reasonable memory usage.

3. **memLevel**:
   - **From 8 to 7**: Slightly reducing the memory level from 8 to 7 will reduce the memory footprint while still maintaining a high level of performance. This change helps to balance memory usage and compression speed, making it more suitable for environments with limited memory resources.

4. **strategy**:
   - **From 0 to 4**: Changing the strategy from 0 (Z_FILTERED) to 4 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) is a safer and more general approach. Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY is designed to work well with a wide range of data types and is typically a good choice when the data type is not known or is mixed. This ensures that the compression algorithm adapts well to different data patterns, potentially improving overall performance.

These changes aim to optimize runtime performance by balancing compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio.
