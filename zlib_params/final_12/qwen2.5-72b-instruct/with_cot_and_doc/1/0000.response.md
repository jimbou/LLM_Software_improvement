```plaintext
level := 7
wbits := '29'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Increased from `6` to `7`. This will slightly increase the compression ratio at the cost of a small decrease in compression speed, which is often a worthwhile trade-off if the goal is better compression efficiency.

2. **wbits**: Increased from `15` to `29`. A larger window size can significantly improve the compression ratio, especially for larger files, but it requires more memory. Since the original value was `15`, which is unusually low and outside the typical range (25-31), increasing it to `29` aligns it with a more standard setting and should enhance the compression efficiency.

3. **memLevel**: Kept at `8`. This value already allocates a high amount of memory for the compression process, which is beneficial for performance. Given that we have increased the window size, maintaining a high memLevel ensures that the additional memory required for the larger window is available, thus optimizing the overall performance.

4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4`. The default strategy (`4`) is generally the best choice for most types of data, as it is designed to handle a wide variety of input efficiently. The original value of `0` (Z_FILTERED) is more specialized and may not provide the best general-purpose performance.

These adjustments should lead to better compression ratios and maintain or even improve the runtime performance, depending on the specific characteristics of the data being compressed.
