```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Reduced from `6` to `5`. This adjustment slightly reduces the compression ratio but significantly improves compression speed, which is beneficial if runtime performance is a priority.
2. **wbits**: Increased from `15` to `28`. The original value of `15` is outside the recommended range (25-31). By setting it to `28`, we achieve a better balance between compression ratio and memory usage.
3. **memLevel**: Increased from `8` to `7`. This slight reduction in memory allocation still provides good performance while reducing memory overhead, which can be important in resource-constrained environments.
4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4`. Using `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` (`4`) is generally more effective for a wide range of data types, providing a better balance between compression ratio and speed compared to `Z_FILTERED` (`0`).

These adjustments aim to optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
