```plaintext
level := 6
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **level**: Kept at `6` to maintain a balance between compression speed and efficiency, as changing this might not significantly impact performance without a clear need for higher or lower compression.
2. **wbits**: Adjusted from `15` to `28` to align with the default and recommended range. A larger window size can improve compression ratios, especially for larger datasets, though it requires more memory.
3. **memLevel**: Increased from `8` to `8` to maximize the memory allocated for internal compression state, which can enhance performance by reducing the overhead of memory management.
4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4` to use the default strategy, which is generally optimized for most types of data. This ensures that the compression algorithm adapts well to the input data, potentially improving both compression ratio and speed.

These changes aim to optimize the configuration for better performance by balancing memory usage and compression efficiency.
