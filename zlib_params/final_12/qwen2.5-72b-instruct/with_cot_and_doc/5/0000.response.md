level := 5
wbits := '29'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **level**:
   - Changed from `6` to `5`. Reducing the compression level slightly can improve runtime performance while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. Level `5` strikes a better balance between speed and compression efficiency compared to level `6`.

2. **wbits**:
   - Changed from `15` to `29`. The original value of `15` is outside the recommended range of `25` to `31`. Increasing it to `29` ensures a larger window size, which can improve compression ratio without excessively increasing memory usage. The window size for `29` is `16,384`, which is a reasonable compromise.

3. **memLevel**:
   - Changed from `8` to `7`. Reducing the memory level slightly can reduce memory usage, which can help in environments with limited memory resources. Level `7` still provides good performance and is a balanced choice.

4. **strategy**:
   - Changed from `0` to `4`. The original strategy of `0` (Z_FILTERED) is typically used for filtered or predictable data. Changing to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) is a safer and more general-purpose choice, suitable for a wide range of data types and potentially improving performance.

These adjustments aim to optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining a good compression ratio and memory efficiency.
