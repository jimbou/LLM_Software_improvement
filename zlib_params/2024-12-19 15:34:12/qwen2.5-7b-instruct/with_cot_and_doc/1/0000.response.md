To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

1. **level**: The current setting is `6`, which is a balanced default level. For many applications, this is a good starting point, but we can explore whether increasing or decreasing it might offer better performance.

2. **wbits**: The current setting is `'15'`. This corresponds to a window size of \(2^{15-16} = 2^(-1) = 1\), which is not valid. It seems there was a typo. Let's assume the intended value is `15`, corresponding to a window size of \(2^{15-16} = 2^{-1} = 1\) (which is incorrect). The correct value should be `25` or higher. Given the range, we'll set it to `25` for better compression without excessive memory usage.

3. **memLevel**: The current setting is `8`, which is quite high. While this can improve compression speed, it also uses a lot of memory. Setting it to `5` provides a good balance between memory usage and performance.

4. **strategy**: The current setting is `0`, which is a good general-purpose choice. However, if we know the nature of the data, we might choose a different strategy to optimize further.

Given these considerations, here is the optimized configuration:

```go
level := 7
wbits := '25'
memLevel := 5
strategy := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **level**: Increased from `6` to `7`. This slight increase in the compression level will generally provide a better compression ratio at the cost of a small decrease in compression speed. This is often a good trade-off for most applications.

2. **wbits**: Corrected from `15` to `25`. This increases the window size to `512`, which can help in achieving better compression ratios, especially for larger datasets. However, it does not significantly increase memory usage compared to the default settings.

3. **memLevel**: Decreased from `8` to `5`. This reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial if memory is a constraint. At `5`, the compression is still relatively fast, providing a good balance between memory and performance.

4. **strategy**: Kept as `0` (Z_FILTERED). This is a good default choice for most general-purpose data. If you have specific knowledge about the data, you might want to experiment with other strategies (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`).

By making these adjustments, the configuration should offer improved performance while maintaining a good balance between compression speed and memory usage.
