To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand the context in which these parameters are used. These parameters are typically related to compression algorithms like Zstandard (zstd), which is used for efficient data compression and decompression. Let's break down each parameter and suggest optimized values:

1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher values result in better compression but require more processing time. A value of `6` is moderate, providing a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

2. **wbits**: This parameter sets the window size in bits. It affects how the compressor looks back in the input stream to find matching sequences. The default value is often `15`, but it can be adjusted based on the specific use case.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter controls the memory usage of the compressor. Higher values use more memory but can provide better compression. A value of `8` is relatively high, meaning it will use more memory to achieve better compression.

4. **strategy**: This parameter defines the strategy used by the compressor. Common values include:
   - `0`: Default strategy (balanced).
   - `1`: Strategy for fast compression.
   - `2`: Strategy for high compression.
   - `3`: Strategy for compression with a fixed dictionary.
   - `4`: Strategy for compression with a sliding window.

Given the context, here are some suggestions to improve the configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **level**: To reduce runtime while maintaining reasonable compression, you can lower this value slightly from `6` to `5`. This will still provide good compression but reduce the processing time.
   
2. **wbits**: For typical use cases, the default value of `15` is usually sufficient. However, if you find that the compression is not as effective as needed, you might consider increasing it to `16` or `17` to allow the compressor to look further back in the input stream.

3. **memLevel**: Reducing this value from `8` to `7` or `6` can help reduce memory usage, which might be beneficial if memory is a constraint. However, this could slightly affect the compression quality.

4. **strategy**: Since the current strategy is `0`, which is balanced, you can keep it as is unless you have specific requirements for faster or higher compression.

### Optimized Configuration:

```go
level := 5
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 0
```

### Explanation:

- **level = 5**: Reduces the compression level to balance between compression ratio and speed.
- **wbits = 15**: Keeps the window size at a reasonable value for most use cases.
- **memLevel = 7**: Reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial if memory constraints are an issue.
- **strategy = 0**: Keeps the compression strategy balanced, which is generally a good default choice.

By making these adjustments, you should see a reduction in runtime without significantly compromising the compression quality.
