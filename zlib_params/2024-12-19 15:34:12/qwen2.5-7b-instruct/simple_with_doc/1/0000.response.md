To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and the compression ratio. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters based on the given documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: Set to `7`
- **wbits**: Set to `29`
- **memLevel**: Set to `6`
- **strategy**: Set to `3`

### Justification for Each Parameter:

1. **level**: Setting `level` to `7` strikes a balance between compression speed and ratio. It is faster than `6` but still provides better compression than `8` or `9`, which would be too slow.

2. **wbits**: Increasing `wbits` to `29` (which corresponds to a window size of `2048`) can help in achieving a better compression ratio for larger datasets. However, it uses more memory, so we choose `29` instead of the maximum `31` to keep memory usage manageable.

3. **memLevel**: Setting `memLevel` to `6` balances memory usage and performance. It is higher than the default `5`, which means slightly more memory will be used, but it should still provide good performance.

4. **strategy**: Setting `strategy` to `3` (Z_FIXED) prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes. This can be useful if you have specific requirements where you want to avoid the overhead of dynamic code updates, which might lead to better performance in certain scenarios.

### Final Configuration:
```go
level := 7
wbits := '29'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 3
```

These settings should provide a good balance between performance and functionality, optimizing the compression process for your specific needs.
