To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, we need to understand what each parameter does and how it affects the runtime. Let's analyze each parameter:

1. **`level`**: This parameter controls the compression level. Higher values mean more compression but also more processing time.
2. **`wbits`**: This parameter specifies the window size in bits. It influences the amount of data that can be processed at once.
3. **`memLevel`**: This parameter controls the memory usage during compression. Higher values use more memory but can result in better compression ratios.
4. **`strategy`**: This parameter determines the compression strategy. Different strategies have different trade-offs between compression ratio and speed.

Given the default settings, we will make some adjustments to balance between compression quality and runtime performance. Here is the optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **`level`**: Set to 4 or 5. This provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.
- **`wbits`**: Set to 16. This is a common value that balances between the amount of data processed at once and memory usage.
- **`memLevel`**: Set to 6. This reduces memory usage while still providing reasonable compression efficiency.
- **`strategy`**: Set to 1 (GZIP). This is a good general-purpose strategy that balances compression ratio and speed.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **`level`**: Reducing from 6 to 4 or 5 decreases the compression level, which speeds up the compression process without significantly reducing the compression ratio.
- **`wbits`**: Increasing from 15 to 16 allows for slightly larger window sizes, which can help in better compression but at a marginal increase in speed cost.
- **`memLevel`**: Decreasing from 8 to 6 reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial if memory is a limiting factor, although it might slightly reduce compression efficiency.
- **`strategy`**: Changing to GZIP (strategy 1) is a good choice as it provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

### Optimized Configuration:
```go
level := 5
wbits := '16'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 1
```

These changes should provide a better balance between compression quality and runtime performance.
