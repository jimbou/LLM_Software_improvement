The parameters you've provided seem to be related to configuring a compression algorithm, likely Zstandard (zstd), which is known for its balance between compression ratio and speed. The parameters are:

- `level`: Compression level.
- `wbits`: Window size.
- `memLevel`: Memory level.
- `strategy`: Strategy for compression.

### Current Configuration:
- `level := 6`
- `wbits := '15'` (Note: This should be an integer, not a string)
- `memLevel := 8`
- `strategy := 0`

### Optimization Goals:
- **Level**: A higher level generally means better compression but slower performance. For optimal runtime efficiency, a lower level is preferred.
- **wbits**: The window size can affect both compression speed and quality. A smaller window size can improve decompression speed but may reduce compression efficiency.
- **memLevel**: This controls the amount of memory used for compression. Lower values use less memory but may result in slightly slower compression.
- **Strategy**: Different strategies can impact the compression process differently. Strategy 0 is typically the fastest but might not provide the best compression.

### Optimized Parameters:
For runtime efficiency, we aim to minimize the compression level while still maintaining reasonable compression quality. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters:

- `level := 3`: This is a good balance between compression speed and quality.
- `wbits := 16`: This is a common choice that balances compression and decompression speed.
- `memLevel := 6`: This uses less memory but maintains good performance.
- `strategy := 0`: Fastest strategy.

### Optimized Configuration:
- `level := 3`
- `wbits := 16`
- `memLevel := 6`
- `strategy := 0`

These settings should provide a good balance between compression speed and quality, optimizing for runtime efficiency.
