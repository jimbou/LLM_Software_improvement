To optimize the given parameter configuration while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to consider the trade-offs between compression speed, memory usage, and compression ratio. Here are the optimized parameter settings along with explanations:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 7
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 3
```

### Explanation:

1. **level (7)**:
   - **Reasoning**: Setting `level` to `7` strikes a balance between compression speed and compression ratio. It is slightly higher than the default `6` but still provides good performance without significantly impacting runtime.

2. **wbits ('28')**:
   - **Reasoning**: The default value for `wbits` is `28`, which corresponds to a window size of `512`. This setting is generally sufficient for most use cases and balances memory usage and compression effectiveness. Increasing `wbits` further might not provide significant benefits in terms of compression ratio and could increase memory requirements unnecessarily.

3. **memLevel (7)**:
   - **Reasoning**: Setting `memLevel` to `7` increases the amount of memory allocated for the internal compression state compared to the default `5`. This can lead to faster compression times at the cost of increased memory usage. However, it is a reasonable trade-off since the application will likely have enough memory available to handle this increased allocation.

4. **strategy (3) - Z_FIXED**:
   - **Reasoning**: Using `Z_FIXED` (strategy `3`) prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes. This can be beneficial when dealing with data that has a predictable pattern or when you want to ensure consistent compression behavior across different runs. While it might result in slightly lower compression ratios compared to using dynamic codes, it can improve stability and predictability, which is often desirable in production environments.

### Summary:
- **level = 7**: Balances compression speed and ratio.
- **wbits = 28**: Maintains a good balance between memory and compression effectiveness.
- **memLevel = 7**: Increases memory usage for faster compression, but remains within a reasonable range.
- **strategy = 3**: Ensures consistent compression behavior by preventing dynamic Huffman code usage.

These changes should help improve runtime performance while maintaining the required functionality of the system.
