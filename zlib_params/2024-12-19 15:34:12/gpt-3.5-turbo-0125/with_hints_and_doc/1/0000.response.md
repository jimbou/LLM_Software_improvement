Based on the provided documentation, the most critical parameters for performance optimization are **level**, **wbits**, **memLevel**, and **strategy**. Here are the suggested optimized values for these parameters to reduce runtime:

1. **level**: Change the value from `6` to `1` for the fastest compression speed.
2. **wbits**: Change the value from `'15'` to `25` for a smaller window size and potentially faster compression.
3. **memLevel**: Change the value from `8` to `1` for minimum memory usage and potentially slower compression.
4. **strategy**: Change the value from `0` to `1` for forcing Huffman encoding only, which can improve compression speed.

By adjusting these parameters as suggested above, the runtime performance of the system should improve while maintaining the functionality of the compression process.
