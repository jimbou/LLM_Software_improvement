level := 5
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 8
strategy := 1

Explanation:
1. Adjusted the 'level' parameter from 6 to 5 as a lower compression level can reduce the time and resources required for compression.
2. Changed the 'strategy' parameter from 0 to 1 as a different strategy can impact the compression performance.
3. The optimized configuration aims to balance compression efficiency with runtime performance, potentially reducing the overall processing time for compression tasks.
