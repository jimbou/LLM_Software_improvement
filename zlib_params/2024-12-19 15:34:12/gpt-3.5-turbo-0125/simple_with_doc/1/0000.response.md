Based on the documentation provided, the optimized parameter configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality would be:

- **level**: 9
- **wbits**: 31
- **memLevel**: 9
- **strategy**: 4

Explanation:
- **level**: Set to the highest value (9) for the slowest compression speed and highest compression ratio.
- **wbits**: Set to the maximum value (31) for a larger window size, which can improve compression ratio at the cost of more memory.
- **memLevel**: Set to the maximum value (9) for potentially faster compression with maximum memory usage.
- **strategy**: Set to the default strategy (4) for normal data, as it is recommended for general compression purposes.

By optimizing these parameters, you can achieve better compression efficiency and potentially faster compression speeds, while still maintaining functionality according to the provided documentation.
