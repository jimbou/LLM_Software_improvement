After analyzing the parameters, the ones most likely to influence runtime performance are **level**, **wbits**, and **memLevel**.

**Optimized Configuration:**
- **level:** 9
- **wbits:** 31
- **memLevel:** 9
- **strategy:** 0

**Explanation:**
1. **level:** Setting the compression level to the maximum value of 9 will prioritize compression ratio over speed. This may result in slightly slower compression but with a higher compression ratio, which can be beneficial depending on the use case.
   
2. **wbits:** Increasing the window size to the maximum value of 31 will allow for a larger history buffer, potentially improving the compression ratio. While this may require more memory, it can enhance the overall performance by capturing more patterns in the data.
   
3. **memLevel:** Allocating the maximum memory level of 9 will ensure faster compression by allowing more memory for internal compression state. This can lead to improved performance, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

4. **strategy:** Keeping the strategy at 0 (Z_FILTERED) is suitable for data produced by a filter or predictor, which can help optimize the compression algorithm for specific types of data.

By optimizing these parameters, the compression process may take slightly longer due to increased complexity, but it should result in a higher compression ratio and potentially faster compression speed overall, making it a more efficient configuration for runtime performance.
