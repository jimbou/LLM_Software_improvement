### Optimized Parameters:

```yml
level: 8
wbits: 28
memLevel: 9
strategy: 3
```

### Explanation:

1.  **level**: Increased from `6` to `8` to achieve a better compression ratio at the cost of slightly slower compression speed. This is a good trade-off for most use cases where data needs to be transferred or stored efficiently.

2.  **wbits**: Changed from `'15'` to `28` to use a larger window size for compression and decompression. This can significantly improve the compression ratio, especially for data with many repeated patterns or sequences. Note that `'15'` is outside the recommended range of `25` to `31`, so we've adjusted it to the default value of `28`, which is a good starting point for most data types.

3.  **memLevel**: Increased from `8` to `9` to allocate more memory for the internal compression state. This can potentially speed up compression at the cost of higher memory usage. Since the default is `5`, we're opting for the maximum memory allocation to prioritize speed.

4.  **strategy**: Kept at `3` (which corresponds to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`) as it's suitable for normal data and provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed. If you're dealing with specific types of data (e.g., filtered, Huffman-only, run-length encoded), you might need to adjust this parameter accordingly.

By optimizing these parameters, you should see improvements in both compression ratio and speed, making it more efficient for data transfer and storage while maintaining the functionality of your application.
