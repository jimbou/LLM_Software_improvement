Based on the provided documentation, the following optimized parameter configuration is suggested to improve runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system:

```markdown
### Optimized Parameters:
level := 5
wbits := '28'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4
```

### Rationale:

1.  **level**: Lowering the compression level from `6` to `5` can improve compression speed without significantly impacting the compression ratio. This change allows for a better balance between speed and efficiency.

2.  **wbits**: Increasing the window size from `15` to `28` (the default value) can improve the compression ratio, especially for larger datasets. However, this change may require more memory. Given the default value is `28`, it's likely the system is designed to handle this window size efficiently.

3.  **memLevel**: Increasing the memory level from `8` to `6` might seem counterintuitive, but the goal here is to balance memory usage with performance. The original value of `8` is higher than the default, suggesting an attempt to optimize for speed at the cost of memory. By adjusting it to `6`, we're aiming for a more balanced approach that doesn't overly compromise on memory usage while still offering good performance.

4.  **strategy**: Changing the strategy from `0` (filtered data) to `4` (default strategy) is recommended unless the data is specifically known to be filtered or have characteristics that would benefit from a different strategy. The default strategy (`4`) is designed to work well with a wide range of data types and is likely to provide a good balance between compression ratio and speed for most use cases.

### Notes:

-   These adjustments are based on the assumption that the system's primary goal is to achieve a balance between runtime performance and compression efficiency. If specific requirements prioritize one aspect over the other, further adjustments may be necessary.
-   Always test the optimized configuration with a representative dataset to validate the performance improvements and ensure that the changes do not negatively impact the system's functionality or other critical metrics.
