### Optimized Parameters:

To improve runtime performance while maintaining system functionality, the following adjustments can be made to the parameter configuration:

#### 1. **level**:
   - **Original Value**: 6
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the compression level from 6 to 5 can significantly decrease the runtime, as higher compression levels require more computational resources and time. Level 5 provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

#### 2. **wbits**:
   - **Original Value**: '15'
   - **Optimized Value**: '12'
   - **Rationale**: The window bits parameter controls the size of the compression window. A smaller window size can lead to faster compression but may slightly reduce the compression ratio. Setting `wbits` to '12' strikes a balance between speed and compression efficiency.

#### 3. **memLevel**:
   - **Original Value**: 8
   - **Optimized Value**: 7
   - **Rationale**: The memory level affects how much memory the compressor uses. Lowering this value from 8 to 7 reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial on systems with limited resources, potentially improving runtime performance without significantly impacting compression efficiency.

#### 4. **strategy**:
   - **Original Value**: 0 (Default strategy, which is often a good all-around choice)
   - **Optimized Value**: No change recommended for most use cases.
   - **Rationale**: The strategy parameter influences the compression algorithm's behavior, focusing on either speed or compression ratio. Unless specific requirements dictate otherwise, the default strategy (0) is generally a safe choice that balances speed and efficiency.

### Optimized Configuration:

- **level**: 5
- **wbits**: '12'
- **memLevel**: 7
- **strategy**: 0 (No change)

### Notes:
- These adjustments are general recommendations and may need to be fine-tuned based on specific application requirements, data types, and performance metrics.
- Always test optimized configurations in a controlled environment to ensure they meet both performance and functionality requirements.
