To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we'll focus on minimizing the time it takes to compress and decompress data, which is typically the primary concern for runtime performance in compression algorithms like those using the parameters provided (likely for a DEFLATE or similar algorithm, given the context of `level`, `wbits`, `memLevel`, and `strategy`).

Here's a brief explanation of each parameter and how to optimize them for runtime efficiency:

1. **Level**: This controls the compression level, with higher levels typically resulting in better compression ratios at the cost of increased computational time. For runtime efficiency, a lower level is preferred, but it must be balanced against the need for reasonable compression. The given level is 6, which is a moderate setting.

2. **wbits**: This parameter controls the window size for the compression algorithm. A larger window size allows for better compression ratios but increases memory usage and computational time. The given value is '15', which is a moderate to high setting.

3. **memLevel**: This controls the amount of memory used for compression. Higher values use more memory but can result in better compression ratios at the cost of increased runtime. The given value is 8, which is a moderate setting.

4. **strategy**: This parameter controls the compression strategy. Common strategies include default (0), filtered (1), Huffman-only (2), and run-length encoding (RLE, 3). The strategy choice affects both compression ratio and speed. The given strategy is 0, which is the default strategy.

### Optimized Parameters for Runtime Efficiency:

To optimize for runtime efficiency, we aim to reduce computational time while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. Here are the optimized parameters:

- **level**: 1 (Fastest compression, least effective compression ratio but significantly faster)
- **wbits**: '8' (Smaller window size reduces memory usage and computational time)
- **memLevel**: 1 (Lowest memory usage for fastest compression)
- **strategy**: 2 (Huffman-only strategy is generally faster than the default strategy)

### Optimized Parameters:
level := 1
wbits := '8'
memLevel := 1
strategy := 2
```

These optimized parameters prioritize runtime efficiency over the best possible compression ratio. They are suitable for applications where fast compression and decompression times are critical, and the trade-off in compression ratio is acceptable.
