### Optimized Parameters:
level := 5
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 1

### Explanation:

The original configuration seems to prioritize compression ratio over speed, given the high `level` and `memLevel` settings. However, to optimize for runtime performance, we need to strike a balance between compression ratio and speed.

**Changes:**

1. **Reduced `level` from 6 to 5**: Lowering the compression level reduces the number of iterations and calculations performed during compression, resulting in faster execution. A level of 5 is still relatively high and should provide a good compression ratio while improving speed.
2. **Adjusted `memLevel` from 8 to 6**: The `memLevel` parameter controls the amount of memory allocated for compression. Reducing it from 8 to 6 decreases memory usage, which can lead to faster compression times, especially on systems with limited resources.
3. **Changed `strategy` from 0 to 1**: The `strategy` parameter influences the compression algorithm's behavior. A value of 1 (Filtered) is generally faster than the default value of 0 (Default Strategy) for most use cases, as it uses a simpler and more efficient filtering approach.

**Impact on Runtime Performance:**

These adjustments should result in improved runtime performance, as they:

* Reduce the computational overhead associated with high compression levels
* Decrease memory allocation, leading to faster compression times on resource-constrained systems
* Utilize a faster compression strategy

By applying these changes, you should experience a noticeable improvement in runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio.
