### Optimized Parameters:

level := 7
wbits := '27'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4

### Explanation:

To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we've made the following adjustments:

1. **level**: Increased from `6` to `7`. This change aims to find a better balance between compression speed and efficiency. While level `6` is the default balanced setting, moving to level `7` might offer a slight improvement in compression ratio without significantly impacting speed, depending on the data being compressed.

2. **wbits**: Changed from `'15'` to `'27'`. The original value of `'15'` is outside the recommended range of `25` to `31`. Setting it to `'27'` brings it within the valid range and provides a more suitable window size for compression and decompression. This change should improve the compression ratio by allowing a larger history buffer.

3. **memLevel**: Adjusted from `8` to `6`. The original value of `8` is higher than necessary for most use cases, indicating a preference for faster compression over memory efficiency. Reducing it to `6` strikes a better balance between memory usage and compression speed, as the default value of `5` might be too low for optimal performance.

4. **strategy**: Changed from `0` to `4`. The original strategy, `Z_FILTERED`, is suited for data produced by a filter or predictor. Switching to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` (`4`) allows the algorithm to adapt to the characteristics of the data being compressed, potentially leading to better compression ratios and speeds for a wide range of data types.

These adjustments aim to enhance the compression ratio and speed by leveraging a more optimal window size, a balanced approach to memory allocation, and an adaptive compression strategy. However, the actual impact on runtime performance may vary depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data being compressed.
