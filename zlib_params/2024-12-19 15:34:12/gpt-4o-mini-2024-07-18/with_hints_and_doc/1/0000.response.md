To optimize the given configuration while maintaining the functionality of the system, we will focus on the parameters that are most critical to performance: **level**, **wbits**, **memLevel**, and **strategy**. Here are the suggested improvements:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **level**: 
   - **Current Value**: `6`
   - **Suggested Value**: `5`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the compression level from `6` to `5` will improve the compression speed without a significant loss in compression efficiency. This is particularly beneficial if the primary goal is to reduce runtime.

2. **wbits**: 
   - **Current Value**: `'15'`
   - **Suggested Value**: `'14'`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the window size from `15` (which corresponds to a window size of `32,768` bytes) to `14` (which corresponds to a window size of `16,384` bytes) will reduce memory usage and can lead to faster compression/decompression times without a substantial drop in compression ratio.

3. **memLevel**: 
   - **Current Value**: `8`
   - **Suggested Value**: `6`
   - **Reason**: Decreasing the memory level from `8` to `6` allows the algorithm to use less memory while still maintaining reasonable performance. This can also help reduce runtime, especially in memory-constrained environments.

4. **strategy**: 
   - **Current Value**: `0`
   - **Suggested Value**: `4`
   - **Reason**: Changing the strategy from `Z_FILTERED` (which is suited for data produced by a filter or predictor) to `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` allows the compression algorithm to adapt dynamically to the data being processed. This can enhance performance for a broader range of data types, potentially improving both speed and efficiency.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
- **level**: `5`
- **wbits**: `'14'`
- **memLevel**: `6`
- **strategy**: `4`

This optimized configuration should result in reduced runtime performance while maintaining the essential functionality of the compression system.
