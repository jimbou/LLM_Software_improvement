To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that directly impact compression speed and efficiency. Here are the steps taken for the optimization:

### Analysis & Adjustments:

1. **level**: 
   - The current level is set to `6`, which is a balanced choice. For improved performance, especially if speed is prioritized over compression efficiency, we can reduce this to `5`. This will provide faster compression at the cost of a slightly lower compression ratio.

2. **wbits**: 
   - Currently set at `15`. While this provides a decent balance, reducing it to `14` can still retain a good compression ratio while improving speed and reducing memory usage slightly. A wbits of `14` corresponds to a window size of 16,384, which is sufficient for most cases without overly taxing memory resources.

3. **memLevel**: 
   - Currently set at `8`, which allocates a significant amount of memory for the compression state. Reducing it to `6` will decrease memory usage and may slightly improve speed, particularly in environments with limited memory resources, while still providing good performance.

4. **strategy**: 
   - The current strategy is `0` (Z_FILTERED). If the data being compressed does not particularly benefit from this strategy, it's advisable to switch to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY). This strategy is generally more efficient for a wide range of data types, potentially improving both speed and compression effectiveness.

### Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
level := 5
wbits := '14'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Level 5**: This change will improve compression speed while still maintaining a reasonable compression ratio. It strikes a better balance for scenarios where speed is essential.
  
- **Wbits 14**: This adjustment reduces the memory footprint and can enhance speed slightly while still allowing for effective compression through a reasonably sized window.

- **MemLevel 6**: This reduction in memory allocation should lead to faster performance in memory-constrained environments, as less overhead is required for maintaining the compression state.

- **Strategy 4 (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY)**: This change will enable the algorithm to dynamically adapt based on the data being compressed, potentially leading to better performance across various data types.

### Expected Impact on Runtime Performance:

The optimized configuration is expected to yield a notable improvement in runtime performance, particularly in terms of compression speed, while still maintaining a solid compression ratio. The reduced memory usage will also help in environments where memory is a constraint, allowing for faster processing and potentially enabling the system to handle more concurrent operations. Overall, this configuration is tailored to achieve a better performance balance for general use cases.
