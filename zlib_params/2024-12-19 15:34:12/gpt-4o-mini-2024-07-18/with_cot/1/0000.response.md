To optimize the given configuration for runtime performance, we need to analyze each parameter and its potential impact on performance:

1. **Parameter Analysis**:
   - **level**: This parameter typically indicates the compression level. A higher value (like 6) usually results in better compression but may increase the processing time due to more complex algorithms being executed.
   - **wbits**: This parameter specifies the window size for the compression algorithm. A value of '15' is relatively high, which can improve compression ratios but also increases memory usage and processing time.
   - **memLevel**: This parameter affects the amount of memory used for internal compression state. A value of '8' indicates a higher memory usage, which can lead to better performance with larger data sets but may not be necessary for smaller data.
   - **strategy**: This defines the compression strategy, where a value of '0' indicates the default strategy. It may not be the most efficient choice for all data types.

2. **Suggested Adjustments**:
   - **level**: Consider lowering the compression level to 4. This may sacrifice some compression efficiency but will likely improve runtime performance due to less intensive processing.
   - **wbits**: Keep this at '15' if the data being compressed is large enough to benefit from a larger window size. If memory consumption becomes an issue, consider lowering it to '14'.
   - **memLevel**: This could potentially be lowered to '4'. This would reduce memory usage while still maintaining reasonable performance for most applications.
   - **strategy**: If the data is known to be text-heavy, changing this to a value like '1' (filtering strategy) may yield better performance compared to the default.

3. **Optimized Configuration**:
   ```plaintext
   level := 4
   wbits := '15'
   memLevel := 4
   strategy := 1
   ```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Level 4**: This reduction from 6 to 4 will decrease the complexity of the compression algorithm, leading to faster processing times while still providing a reasonable compression ratio.
- **wbits 15**: Keeping this high allows for optimal compression ratios for larger datasets while taking advantage of the memory available.
- **memLevel 4**: By lowering this, we reduce memory consumption, which can help improve speed, especially in environments with limited memory resources.
- **Strategy 1**: Choosing a filtering strategy can enhance performance for specific data types, potentially improving speed and efficiency when compressing certain datasets.

Overall, these changes strike a balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance, making the configuration more suitable for a broader range of applications while maintaining reasonable resource usage.
