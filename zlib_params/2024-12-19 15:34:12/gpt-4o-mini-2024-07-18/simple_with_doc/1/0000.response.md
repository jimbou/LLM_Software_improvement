To improve runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can analyze each parameter based on their impact on speed and memory usage. Hereâ€™s the optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **level**: `4`
   - **Rationale**: Lowering the compression level from `6` to `4` can increase speed while still providing a reasonable compression ratio. This offers a good balance between performance and efficiency.

2. **wbits**: `15`
   - **Rationale**: Keeping `wbits` at `15` is reasonable. It provides a window size of `32,768`, which is often sufficient for good compression without overly taxing memory.

3. **memLevel**: `6`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the memory level from `5` to `6` allows for better performance through the allocation of slightly more memory for the compression state, enabling more efficient operations without drastically increasing memory usage.

4. **strategy**: `4`
   - **Rationale**: Changing the strategy from `0` to `4` (Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY) can optimize performance for general data types, benefiting from the adaptive nature of the algorithm for various data patterns.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
level := 4
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 6
strategy := 4
```

This configuration aims to enhance runtime performance by optimizing compression speed while maintaining an adequate level of compression efficiency and functionality for various data types.
