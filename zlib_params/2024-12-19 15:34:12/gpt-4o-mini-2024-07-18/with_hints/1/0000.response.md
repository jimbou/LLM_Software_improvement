To optimize the parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining system functionality, it's essential to focus on the most critical parameters affecting performance in scenarios such as compression or decompression tasks. Hereâ€™s an analysis of the parameters you've provided:

1. **level**: This parameter typically indicates the compression level. Higher levels (e.g., 6) may yield better compression ratios but can significantly slow down the process. If runtime performance is a priority, consider lowering this value.

2. **wbits**: This parameter usually defines the size of the sliding window used in compression. A larger window can lead to better compression but at the cost of increased memory usage and processing time. A value of 15 is generally high and can be reduced for better performance.

3. **memLevel**: This determines the amount of memory used for internal buffers. Lowering this value can help reduce memory usage at the expense of compression efficiency. A value of 8 is relatively high; you might consider lowering it to see if performance improves without compromising too much on compression.

4. **strategy**: The strategy parameter allows for different methods of compression. The value of 0 usually means a default strategy. Depending on the specific needs (like speed vs. compression ratio), you might consider changing this to a more speed-oriented strategy if available.

### Recommended Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: 3 (This offers a good compromise between speed and compression ratio.)
- **wbits**: 11 (This provides a reasonable balance between speed and compression efficiency.)
- **memLevel**: 4 (This reduces memory usage while still allowing for decent performance.)
- **strategy**: 1 (Assuming this corresponds to a speed-oriented strategy, it should enhance runtime performance.)

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
level := 3
wbits := '11'
memLevel := 4
strategy := 1
```

### Rationale:
- Lowering the `level` reduces the computational overhead associated with higher compression levels.
- Reducing `wbits` decreases the memory footprint and can accelerate processing times in many cases.
- A lower `memLevel` reduces the memory used for buffers, which can also speed up operations.
- Choosing a strategy that prioritizes speed helps further enhance runtime performance.

Make sure to test these configurations in your specific environment, as the optimal settings can vary based on the nature of the data being processed and the overall system architecture.
