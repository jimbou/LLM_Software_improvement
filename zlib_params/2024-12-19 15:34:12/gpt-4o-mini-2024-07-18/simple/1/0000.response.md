To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider the parameters you provided in the context of compression algorithms, likely referring to zlib or a similar library. Here's a brief explanation of the parameters:

1. **level (Compression Level)**: This typically ranges from 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression). Lower levels generally lead to faster compression times at the cost of compression ratio.
   
2. **wbits (Window Bits)**: This parameter defines the size of the sliding window used for compression. A value of '15' is the maximum and provides the best compression but may be slower. Lower values reduce memory usage and can speed up processing.

3. **memLevel (Memory Level)**: This parameter affects the amount of memory allocated for internal compression state. A lower value will use less memory and may speed up processing at the cost of compression performance.

4. **strategy**: This parameter influences the algorithm used for compression. A strategy of `0` typically means default, but for runtime efficiency, a different strategy might be more appropriate depending on the data.

### Recommended Optimized Parameters:
For optimizing runtime efficiency, you typically want to sacrifice some compression ratio for speed. Here are the suggested modifications:

- **level**: Change from `6` to `1` or `2` (lower compression level for faster performance).
- **wbits**: Consider reducing from `'15'` to `'11'` or `'12'` (this will decrease memory usage and speed up compression).
- **memLevel**: Reduce from `8` to `4` (less memory usage may increase speed).
- **strategy**: You might want to choose a strategy that is optimized for speed. If available, consider using `Z_FILTERED` (1) or `Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY` (2) if your data is suitable for those strategies.

### Final Optimized Parameters:
```
level := 1
wbits := '12'
memLevel := 4
strategy := 1  // or 2, depending on the nature of your data
```

These optimized parameters should enhance runtime efficiency while still maintaining reasonable compression performance. Always consider testing different configurations based on the specific characteristics of the data you're working with.
