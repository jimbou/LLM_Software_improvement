Certainly! The parameters you've provided are related to the Zstd compression library, which is widely used for efficient data compression and decompression. Let's analyze each parameter and suggest optimizations:

1. **level**: This parameter controls the compression level, where a higher value means better compression but slower runtime. A level of 6 is moderate. For runtime efficiency, you can reduce this slightly to achieve a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

2. **wbits**: This parameter specifies the window size in bits. It affects the memory usage and compression quality. Setting it to '15' (which is equivalent to 15 bits) is generally reasonable for many use cases. However, if you need to further optimize for runtime, you might consider a lower value, but be cautious as it could affect compression quality.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter sets the memory level used for compression. Higher values use more memory but can provide better compression. Since you have set it to 8, which is quite high, you might want to reduce it slightly to improve runtime performance.

4. **strategy**: This parameter controls the compression strategy. A value of 0 typically means "default" strategy, which is a good starting point. If you're looking for optimization, you might experiment with other strategies like 1 (filtering) or 3 (backwards search), but the default often provides a good balance.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **level**: Reduce from 6 to 5 or 4 to improve runtime.
- **wbits**: Keep at 15 unless you notice a significant impact on compression quality.
- **memLevel**: Lower from 8 to 7 or 6 to improve runtime.
- **strategy**: Stick with 0 unless you have specific needs.

### Suggested Optimized Configuration:
```python
level := 5
wbits := '15'
memLevel := 7
strategy := 0
```

This configuration should offer a good balance between compression efficiency and runtime performance.
