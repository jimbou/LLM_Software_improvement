**Optimized Parameters for Runtime Efficiency**

After analyzing the given parameters, I've identified the most impactful ones on runtime performance and suggest the following optimized values:

### Optimized Parameters:

* `level`: 1 (instead of 6)
* `wbits`: '15' (no change)
* `memLevel`: 1 (instead of 8)
* `strategy`: 0 (no change)

**Rationale:**

1. **`level`**: A lower compression level (1) will result in faster compression and decompression times, as it requires less computational effort. This is a good trade-off for runtime efficiency, as the compression ratio may not be significantly affected.
2. **`memLevel`**: Reducing the memory level (1) will decrease the amount of memory allocated for compression, leading to faster execution times. This is particularly important for systems with limited memory resources.
3. **`wbits`**: The window size (`wbits`) is already set to a relatively small value ('15'), which is a good balance between compression ratio and runtime performance. No change is recommended.
4. **`strategy`**: The strategy parameter (0) is likely set to the default or most efficient value, so no change is suggested.

**Example Use Case:**
```python
import zlib

# Original parameters
level = 6
wbits = 15
memLevel = 8
strategy = 0

# Optimized parameters
optimized_level = 1
optimized_wbits = wbits
optimized_memLevel = 1
optimized_strategy = strategy

# Create a compressor with optimized parameters
compressor = zlib.compressobj(optimized_level, optimized_wbits, optimized_memLevel, optimized_strategy)

# Use the compressor to compress data
compressed_data = compressor.compress(b"Hello, World!")
```
By applying these optimized parameters, you can expect a significant reduction in runtime without compromising the functionality of your compression algorithm.
