To optimize for runtime efficiency, we can focus on the following parameters:

1. `level`: This parameter controls the compression level. Lower levels generally result in faster compression but with less compression ratio. Setting `level` to a lower value can improve runtime efficiency. Let's set it to 3.

2. `wbits`: This parameter specifies the window size for compression. Using a smaller window size can improve runtime efficiency at the cost of compression ratio. Let's set `wbits` to 12.

3. `memLevel`: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for compression. Lower values reduce memory usage but may impact compression efficiency. Let's set `memLevel` to 4.

4. `strategy`: This parameter determines the strategy used for compression. Setting it to 0 (default strategy) is generally a good choice for a balance between speed and compression ratio.

Optimized parameters for best runtime performance:
- level := 3
- wbits := 12
- memLevel := 4
- strategy := 0

These parameter values should help improve the runtime efficiency of the compression process while still maintaining functionality.
