To optimize the parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to consider how each parameter impacts performance, particularly in relation to compression algorithms (like zlib, for example). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each parameter:

1. **level**: This parameter typically ranges from 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression). Higher levels increase the time taken for compression and decompression. For the best runtime performance, a lower level is often preferable. A common trade-off is to use a level of 3 or 4 for a reasonable balance between speed and compression efficiency.

2. **wbits**: This parameter specifies the window size for the compression algorithm. A value of 15 is maximum for zlib, which can provide better compression ratios, but at the cost of performance. Reducing this value to 12 or even 8 might significantly improve runtime while still providing reasonable compression.

3. **memLevel**: This parameter indicates how much memory is allocated for the internal compression state. A lower value can reduce memory usage and potentially improve speed, but it might lead to a lower compression ratio. Setting this to a value like 4 can often provide a good balance between speed and memory usage.

4. **strategy**: This parameter affects the compression strategy used. The default value of 0 generally provides a good balance. If performance is critical, consider using `strategy := 1`, which is the filtered strategy and can be faster for data that is somewhat structured or predictable.

### Optimized Parameters:
Based on the analysis above, here are the optimized parameters for better runtime performance:

```plaintext
level := 3  ; Lower compression level for faster performance
wbits := 12  ; Reduced window size for faster compression
memLevel := 4  ; Lower memory usage to enhance speed
strategy := 1  ; Use filtered strategy for potentially faster performance
```

### Summary:
- **level = 3**: A compromise between speed and compression efficiency.
- **wbits = 12**: Reduces the complexity of the algorithm.
- **memLevel = 4**: Optimizes memory usage for faster processing.
- **strategy = 1**: Adjusts the algorithm's approach to enhance speed.

These adjustments should help minimize runtime while maintaining acceptable functionality in terms of compression quality.
