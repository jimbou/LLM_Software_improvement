To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully consider the impact of each parameter on the solver's behavior. Hereâ€™s a suggested optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Keep Luby restarts as it generally performs well.
rnd-init := 'False'  # Random initialization can introduce unnecessary variability.
gc-frac := 0.3  # Increase garbage collection fraction to manage memory more efficiently.
rinc := 1.5  # Reduce the conflict bound increase factor to avoid frequent restarts.
var-decay := 0.9  # Slightly reduce variable activity decay to focus more on recent activities.
cla-decay := 0.99  # Slightly reduce clause activity decay to keep more relevant clauses.
rnd-freq := 0.05  # Introduce a small random frequency to escape local minima.
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Keep the same seed for reproducibility.
phase-saving := 2  # Keep phase saving level as is.
ccmin-mode := 2  # Keep the clause cleaning mode as is.
rfirst := 50  # Lower the initial conflict bound to speed up early solving.
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing is beneficial and should be kept.
verb := '1'  # Keep verbosity level as is for monitoring.
rcheck := 'False'  # Redundancy checks can slow down the solver.
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking can be computationally expensive.
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination is useful and should be kept.
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Keep the simplification garbage collection fraction as is.
sub-lim := 500  # Lower the subsumption limit to reduce overhead.
cl-lim := 10  # Lower the clause limit to reduce memory usage.
grow := 0  # Keep the growth factor as is.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Luby Restarts (`luby := 'True'`)**: Luby restarts are generally effective and help in escaping local minima. Keeping this setting ensures that the solver benefits from the Luby sequence's properties.

2. **Garbage Collection Fraction (`gc-frac := 0.3`)**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction helps manage memory more efficiently, which can improve performance, especially for large problems.

3. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor (`rinc := 1.5`)**: Reducing this factor can prevent too frequent restarts, which can help the solver spend more time on potentially fruitful search paths.

4. **Variable Activity Decay (`var-decay := 0.9`)**: Slightly reducing the decay factor helps the solver focus more on recent activities, which can be beneficial for dynamic problem-solving.

5. **Clause Activity Decay (`cla-decay := 0.99`)**: Slightly reducing the decay factor keeps more relevant clauses, which can improve the solver's ability to learn from past conflicts.

6. **Random Frequency (`rnd-freq := 0.05`)**: Introducing a small random frequency can help the solver escape local minima and explore different parts of the search space.

7. **Initial Conflict Bound (`rfirst := 50`)**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can speed up the early stages of the solving process.

8. **Subsumption Limit (`sub-lim := 500`)**: Reducing the subsumption limit can decrease the overhead associated with subsumption checks, which can improve performance.

9. **Clause Limit (`cl-lim := 10`)**: Lowering the clause limit reduces memory usage, which can be beneficial for large problems.

By making these adjustments, the solver should exhibit improved runtime performance while maintaining its ability to solve the given problems effectively.
