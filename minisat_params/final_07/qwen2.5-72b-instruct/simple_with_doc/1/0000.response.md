To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their impact on performance and the constraints provided. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Enable Luby restarts for potentially better performance on hard instances.
rnd-init := 'False'  # Random initialization can sometimes help but is generally not necessary.
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduce garbage collection frequency to minimize overhead.
rinc := 1.5  # Decrease the conflict bound increase factor to avoid overly aggressive restarts.
var-decay := 0.9  # Slightly reduce the variable activity decay to focus more on recent activities.
cla-decay := 0.995  # Slightly reduce the clause activity decay to keep more relevant clauses.
rnd-freq := 0.05  # Introduce a small amount of randomness to escape local optima.
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Keep the same seed for reproducibility.
phase-saving := 2  # Maintain phase saving level for stability.
ccmin-mode := 2  # Continue with the current conflict clause minimization mode.
rfirst := 50  # Lower the initial conflict bound to start solving faster.
pre := 'True'  # Enable preprocessing to simplify the problem before solving.
verb := '0'  # Disable verbose output to reduce I/O overhead.
rcheck := 'False'  # Disable restart checks to save time.
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetric branching is not necessary for most problems.
elim := 'True'  # Enable variable elimination to simplify the problem further.
simp-gc-frac := 0.3  # Adjust the simplification garbage collection fraction to balance between memory and performance.
sub-lim := 500  # Reduce the subsumption limit to speed up the process.
cl-lim := 10  # Lower the clause length limit to reduce the number of long clauses.
grow := 0  # Keep the grow parameter at 0 to avoid unnecessary growth.
```

### Explanation:
1. **luby := 'True'**: Luby restarts are generally effective for hard instances and can help in finding solutions faster.
2. **gc-frac := 0.1**: Reducing the garbage collection frequency can significantly reduce overhead, especially in large problems.
3. **rinc := 1.5**: A lower conflict bound increase factor can prevent overly aggressive restarts, which can lead to better performance.
4. **var-decay := 0.9**: Slightly reducing the variable activity decay helps focus more on recent activities, which can be beneficial for dynamic problems.
5. **cla-decay := 0.995**: Slightly reducing the clause activity decay keeps more relevant clauses, which can improve the solver's effectiveness.
6. **rnd-freq := 0.05**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help escape local optima without significantly impacting performance.
7. **rfirst := 50**: Lowering the initial conflict bound allows the solver to start solving the problem faster.
8. **verb := '0'**: Disabling verbose output reduces I/O overhead, which can improve performance.
9. **sub-lim := 500**: Reducing the subsumption limit speeds up the process by limiting the number of subsumption checks.
10. **cl-lim := 10**: Lowering the clause length limit reduces the number of long clauses, which can improve performance.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the solver.
