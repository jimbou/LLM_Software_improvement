To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully select parameters that can enhance the solver's efficiency without compromising its effectiveness. Here are the optimized parameters based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Enables Luby restart strategy, which is generally effective for a wide range of problems.
rnd-init := 'False'  # No random initialization, which is usually not necessary unless specific randomness is required.
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduced garbage collection fraction to minimize overhead.
rinc := 1.5  # Reduced conflict bound increase factor to balance between frequent and infrequent restarts.
var-decay := 0.9  # Slightly reduced variable activity decay to maintain a good balance between recent and older activities.
cla-decay := 0.99  # Kept the same as it is already a good value for clause activity decay.
rnd-freq := 0.0  # No random frequency, which is often not needed for most problems.
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Kept the same for reproducibility.
phase-saving := 2  # Phase saving level kept the same as it is a reasonable default.
ccmin-mode := 2  # Clause cleaning mode kept the same as it is effective.
rfirst := 50  # Reduced initial conflict bound to allow more frequent early restarts.
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing enabled to simplify the problem before solving.
verb := '1'  # Verbosity level kept the same for basic logging.
rcheck := 'False'  # Restart check disabled to reduce overhead.
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking disabled as it can add complexity without significant benefit.
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination enabled to simplify the problem.
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Garbage collection fraction for simplification kept the same.
sub-lim := 500  # Reduced subsumption limit to speed up the process.
cl-lim := 10  # Reduced clause limit to reduce memory usage and speed up the process.
grow := 0  # No growth factor, which is appropriate for most problems.
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`gc-frac := 0.1`**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help minimize the overhead associated with frequent garbage collection, potentially improving runtime performance.
2. **`rinc := 1.5`**: Lowering the conflict bound increase factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima more effectively.
3. **`var-decay := 0.9`**: Slightly reducing the variable activity decay can help maintain a balance between recent and older activities, which can be beneficial for problem-solving.
4. **`rfirst := 50`**: Reducing the initial conflict bound allows for more frequent early restarts, which can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more quickly.
5. **`sub-lim := 500`**: Reducing the subsumption limit can speed up the process by limiting the amount of time spent on subsumption checks.
6. **`cl-lim := 10`**: Reducing the clause limit can reduce memory usage and speed up the process by limiting the number of clauses retained.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and improve the overall efficiency of the solver.
