To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully select parameters that can significantly impact the solver's efficiency. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Enables Luby restart strategy, which is generally effective.
rnd-init := 'False'  # No random initialization, as it can introduce unnecessary variability.
gc-frac := 0.2  # Garbage collection fraction remains the same, as it is already balanced.
rinc := 2.0  # Conflict bound increase factor remains the same, as it is a good balance.
var-decay := 0.95  # Variable activity decay factor remains the same, as it is a good balance.
cla-decay := 0.999  # Clause activity decay factor remains the same, as it is a good balance.
rnd-freq := 0.0  # No random frequency, as it can introduce unnecessary variability.
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Seed for randomness remains the same, as it ensures reproducibility.
phase-saving := 2  # Phase saving level remains the same, as it is a good balance.
ccmin-mode := 2  # Clause cleaning mode remains the same, as it is a good balance.
rfirst := 100  # Initial conflict bound remains the same, as it is a good starting point.
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing is enabled, which can significantly improve performance.
verb := '1'  # Verbosity level remains the same, as it provides useful information.
rcheck := 'False'  # Redundancy check is disabled, as it can be computationally expensive.
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking is disabled, as it can be computationally expensive.
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination is enabled, which can improve performance.
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Simplification garbage collection fraction remains the same, as it is a good balance.
sub-lim := 1000  # Subsumption limit remains the same, as it is a good balance.
cl-lim := 20  # Clause length limit remains the same, as it is a good balance.
grow := 0  # Growth limit remains the same, as it is a good balance.
```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Restart Strategy**:
   - Since `luby` is set to `True`, the Luby restart strategy is being used, which is generally effective for a wide range of problems. However, you might want to experiment with other strategies like `Glucose21Restarts` or `MiniSATRestarts` to see if they provide better performance for your specific problem.

2. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor**:
   - The `rinc` value of 2.0 is a good starting point. If you find that the solver is not making enough progress, you might consider increasing this value slightly (e.g., to 2.5).

3. **Variable and Clause Activity Decay**:
   - The `var-decay` and `cla-decay` values are set to 0.95 and 0.999, respectively, which are good defaults. Adjusting these values can help fine-tune the solver's behavior. For example, decreasing `var-decay` can make the solver more aggressive in focusing on recently active variables.

4. **Preprocessing and Simplification**:
   - Enabling preprocessing (`pre := 'True'`) and variable elimination (`elim := 'True'`) is crucial for improving performance. These steps can significantly reduce the problem size before the main solving process begins.

5. **Verbosity**:
   - The verbosity level (`verb := '1'`) is set to a moderate level, which is good for monitoring the solver's progress without overwhelming log output.

By following these recommendations, you should be able to achieve better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the solver. If further optimization is needed, consider running experiments with different parameter values to find the best configuration for your specific use case.
