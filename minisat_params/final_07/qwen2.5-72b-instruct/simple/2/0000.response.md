Optimizing the parameters for runtime efficiency in a SAT solver or similar algorithmic context involves balancing between various factors such as memory usage, search space exploration, and convergence speed. Here are some adjustments to your parameters that might improve runtime performance:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **luby**: `'True'` (Keep this as is. Luby restarts can help escape local minima.)
2. **rnd-init**: `'False'` (Random initialization is generally not necessary for most problems.)
3. **gc-frac**: `0.1` (Reduce garbage collection frequency to save time, but ensure it's still frequent enough to prevent excessive memory usage.)
4. **rinc**: `1.5` (Decrease the restart increment factor to allow more frequent restarts, which can help explore different parts of the search space.)
5. **var-decay**: `0.9` (Slightly decrease the variable decay rate to give more weight to recent activity.)
6. **cla-decay**: `0.99` (Slightly decrease the clause decay rate to give more weight to recent conflicts.)
7. **rnd-freq**: `0.02` (Introduce a small random frequency to add diversity to the search.)
8. **rnd-seed**: `91648253` (Keep this as is unless you want to experiment with different seeds.)
9. **phase-saving**: `1` (Reduce phase saving to speed up the initial phases of the search.)
10. **ccmin-mode**: `1` (Use a less aggressive clause cleaning mode to reduce overhead.)
11. **rfirst**: `50` (Reduce the initial restart interval to start exploring the search space more quickly.)
12. **pre**: `'True'` (Preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance.)
13. **verb**: `'0'` (Set verbosity to 0 to minimize logging and output, which can slow down the process.)
14. **rcheck**: `'False'` (Keep this as is to avoid the overhead of regular checks.)
15. **asymm**: `'False'` (Asymmetry breaking is often not necessary and can add overhead.)
16. **elim**: `'True'` (Variable elimination can simplify the problem and improve performance.)
17. **simp-gc-frac**: `0.3` (Adjust the simplification garbage collection fraction to balance between memory usage and performance.)
18. **sub-lim**: `500` (Reduce the subproblem limit to focus on more promising areas of the search space.)
19. **cl-lim**: `10` (Reduce the clause learning limit to speed up the learning process, but ensure it's still effective.)
20. **grow**: `0` (Keep this as is to avoid unnecessary growth of the search space.)

### Summary of Changes:
- Reduced `gc-frac` from 0.2 to 0.1.
- Reduced `rinc` from 2.0 to 1.5.
- Reduced `var-decay` from 0.95 to 0.9.
- Reduced `cla-decay` from 0.999 to 0.99.
- Introduced a small `rnd-freq` of 0.02.
- Reduced `phase-saving` from 2 to 1.
- Changed `ccmin-mode` from 2 to 1.
- Reduced `rfirst` from 100 to 50.
- Set `verb` to 0.
- Reduced `simp-gc-frac` from 0.5 to 0.3.
- Reduced `sub-lim` from 1000 to 500.
- Reduced `cl-lim` from 20 to 10.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and speed up the overall process while maintaining the effectiveness of the solver. Always test these changes on a representative set of problems to ensure they provide the desired performance improvements.
