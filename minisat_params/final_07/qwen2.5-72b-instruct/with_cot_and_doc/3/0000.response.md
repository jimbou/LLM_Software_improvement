To optimize the given configuration, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on runtime performance. These typically include restart strategies, decay factors, and simplification levels. Here's a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **Restart Strategy (`luby`)**:
   - Current: `True` (LubyRestarts)
   - Impact: Luby restarts can help escape local minima but might lead to frequent restarts, which can slow down the solver if not managed well.

2. **Restart Factor (`gc-frac`)**:
   - Current: `0.2`
   - Impact: This controls the fraction of learned clauses to keep during garbage collection. A lower value can reduce memory usage but might discard useful clauses.

3. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor (`rinc`)**:
   - Current: `2.0`
   - Impact: This factor determines how quickly the conflict bound increases. A higher value can lead to fewer but more effective restarts.

4. **Variable Decay (`var-decay`)**:
   - Current: `0.95`
   - Impact: This controls how quickly variable activities decay. A higher value means variables retain their activity longer, which can help in making better decisions.

5. **Clause Decay (`cla-decay`)**:
   - Current: `0.999`
   - Impact: This controls how quickly clause activities decay. A higher value means clauses retain their activity longer, which can help in maintaining the relevance of learned clauses.

6. **Initial Conflict Bound (`rfirst`)**:
   - Current: `100`
   - Impact: This sets the initial conflict bound for restarts. A higher value can delay the first restart, potentially leading to longer initial runs.

7. **Simplification (`pre`)**:
   - Current: `True`
   - Impact: Enabling simplification can reduce the problem size and improve performance, but it can also add overhead.

8. **Garbage Collection Fraction for Simplification (`simp-gc-frac`)**:
   - Current: `0.5`
   - Impact: This controls the fraction of learned clauses to keep during simplification. A lower value can reduce memory usage but might discard useful clauses.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

1. **Restart Strategy**:
   - Change from `LubyRestarts` to `Glucose21Restarts` to balance between frequent and less frequent restarts.
   - Set `CLEANING` to `LBD2` as required by `Glucose21Restarts`.

2. **Restart Factor**:
   - Increase `gc-frac` to `0.3` to keep more clauses, which can help in maintaining the context and reducing the number of restarts.

3. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor**:
   - Decrease `rinc` to `1.8` to balance the frequency of restarts and the effectiveness of each restart.

4. **Variable Decay**:
   - Keep `var-decay` at `0.95` as it is a good balance between retaining activity and allowing new variables to gain importance.

5. **Clause Decay**:
   - Keep `cla-decay` at `0.999` to maintain the relevance of learned clauses.

6. **Initial Conflict Bound**:
   - Increase `rfirst` to `200` to delay the first restart and allow for a more thorough initial search.

7. **Simplification**:
   - Keep `pre` as `True` to benefit from the reduction in problem size.

8. **Garbage Collection Fraction for Simplification**:
   - Increase `simp-gc-frac` to `0.6` to keep more clauses during simplification, which can help in maintaining the context.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Change to Glucose21Restarts
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3   # Increase to keep more clauses
rinc := 1.8      # Decrease to balance restart frequency
var-decay := 0.95
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 200    # Increase to delay the first restart
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.6  # Increase to keep more clauses during simplification
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Restart Strategy**:
   - Switching to `Glucose21Restarts` provides a balanced approach to restarts, which can help in both escaping local minima and maintaining progress.

2. **Restart Factor**:
   - Increasing `gc-frac` to `0.3` helps in keeping more learned clauses, which can reduce the number of restarts and maintain context.

3. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor**:
   - Decreasing `rinc` to `1.8` balances the frequency of restarts, ensuring that each restart is more effective.

4. **Initial Conflict Bound**:
   - Increasing `rfirst` to `200` delays the first restart, allowing for a more thorough initial search and potentially finding solutions faster.

5. **Garbage Collection Fraction for Simplification**:
   - Increasing `simp-gc-frac` to `0.6` keeps more clauses during simplification, which can help in maintaining the context and reducing the need for frequent restarts.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reducing unnecessary restarts while maintaining the effectiveness of the solver.
