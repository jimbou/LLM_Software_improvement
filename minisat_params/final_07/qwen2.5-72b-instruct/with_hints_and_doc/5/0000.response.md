To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These typically include restart strategies, decay factors, and simplification levels. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Disable Luby restarts as they can be slower
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 1.5  # Reduce the conflict bound increase factor for faster convergence
var-decay := 0.95
cla-decay := 0.995  # Slightly reduce the clause decay factor for better clause management
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50  # Lower the initial conflict bound for quicker restarts
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
restarts := 'Glucose21Restarts'  # Use Glucose21Restarts for a balance between speed and effectiveness
cleaning := 'LBD2'  # Use LBD2 for efficient clause cleaning
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`luby := 'False'`**: Disabling Luby restarts can improve performance because the Luby sequence can introduce longer periods without restarts, which might slow down the solving process.

2. **`rinc := 1.5`**: Reducing the conflict bound increase factor from 2.0 to 1.5 can help the solver converge more quickly, as it will not wait as long before increasing the conflict bound.

3. **`cla-decay := 0.995`**: Slightly reducing the clause decay factor from 0.999 to 0.995 can help manage the clause database more efficiently, potentially reducing memory usage and improving performance.

4. **`rfirst := 50`**: Lowering the initial conflict bound from 100 to 50 can lead to more frequent restarts early in the solving process, which can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more quickly.

5. **`restarts := 'Glucose21Restarts'`**: Switching to `Glucose21Restarts` provides a good balance between speed and effectiveness, as it uses a dynamic restart strategy that adapts to the problem being solved.

6. **`cleaning := 'LBD2'`**: Using `LBD2` for clause cleaning ensures efficient management of learned clauses, which is important for maintaining performance over time.

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the functionality and effectiveness of the solver.
