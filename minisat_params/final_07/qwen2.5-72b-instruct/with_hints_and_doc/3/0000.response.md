To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These include the restart strategy, decay factors, and simplification levels. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **luby**:
   - **Current Value**: 'True'
   - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
   - **Reason**: The Luby restart strategy can be beneficial in certain scenarios, but it often introduces more overhead. Disabling it might reduce the overhead and improve performance.

2. **rnd-init**:
   - **Current Value**: 'False'
   - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
   - **Reason**: Random initialization is generally not necessary unless you have specific reasons to believe it will help with your problem instance.

3. **gc-frac**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.2
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.3
   - **Reason**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively, potentially reducing the number of garbage collection cycles and improving performance.

4. **rinc**:
   - **Current Value**: 2.0
   - **Optimized Value**: 1.5
   - **Reason**: Reducing the conflict bound increase factor can help the solver converge faster, especially in problems where the default value leads to excessive restarts.

5. **var-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.95
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.9
   - **Reason**: A lower variable decay factor can help the solver focus more on recently active variables, which can improve performance in many cases.

6. **cla-decay**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.999
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.99
   - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause decay factor can help the solver forget less important clauses more quickly, which can improve performance.

7. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.0
   - **Reason**: Random frequency is set to 0, which is appropriate if you do not want to introduce randomness into the decision-making process.

8. **phase-saving**:
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 1
   - **Reason**: Reducing phase saving can help the solver make more aggressive decisions, which can sometimes lead to faster convergence.

9. **ccmin-mode**:
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 1
   - **Reason**: Setting the clause cleaning mode to 1 (LBD) can help reduce the overhead associated with more aggressive cleaning strategies.

10. **rfirst**:
    - **Current Value**: 100
    - **Optimized Value**: 50
    - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can help the solver start making progress more quickly, especially in the early stages of solving.

11. **pre**:
    - **Current Value**: 'True'
    - **Optimized Value**: 'True'
    - **Reason**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled.

12. **verb**:
    - **Current Value**: '1'
    - **Optimized Value**: '0'
    - **Reason**: Reducing verbosity can slightly improve performance by reducing the overhead of logging and output.

13. **rcheck**:
    - **Current Value**: 'False'
    - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
    - **Reason**: Redundancy checking is not necessary unless you suspect issues with the input problem.

14. **asymm**:
    - **Current Value**: 'False'
    - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
    - **Reason**: Asymmetry breaking is not always beneficial and can add overhead, so it should remain disabled.

15. **elim**:
    - **Current Value**: 'True'
    - **Optimized Value**: 'True'
    - **Reason**: Variable elimination is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled.

16. **simp-gc-frac**:
    - **Current Value**: 0.5
    - **Optimized Value**: 0.6
    - **Reason**: Increasing the simplification garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively during simplification.

17. **sub-lim**:
    - **Current Value**: 1000
    - **Optimized Value**: 500
    - **Reason**: Reducing the subsumption limit can help the solver avoid excessive subsumption checks, which can be computationally expensive.

18. **cl-lim**:
    - **Current Value**: 20
    - **Optimized Value**: 15
    - **Reason**: Reducing the clause limit can help the solver manage memory more effectively and avoid storing too many clauses.

19. **grow**:
    - **Current Value**: 0
    - **Optimized Value**: 0
    - **Reason**: The grow parameter is set to 0, which is appropriate if you do not want to allow the solver to dynamically adjust its behavior.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 'False'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 1
ccmin-mode := 1
rfirst := 50
pre := 'True'
verb := '0'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.6
sub-lim := 500
cl-lim := 15
grow := 0
```

This configuration aims to reduce overhead, improve memory management, and enhance the solver's ability to converge quickly, while still maintaining the necessary functionality.
