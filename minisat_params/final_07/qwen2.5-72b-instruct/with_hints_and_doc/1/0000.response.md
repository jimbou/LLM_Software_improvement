To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the most critical parameters that can significantly impact performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Disable Luby restarts as they can be expensive
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2  # Keep this value as it balances between memory usage and performance
rinc := 2.0  # Keep this value as it provides a good balance for conflict-bound increase
var-decay := 0.95  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
cla-decay := 0.999  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
rnd-freq := 0.0  # Keep this value as randomization is not needed here
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Keep this value as it is a seed and does not affect performance directly
phase-saving := 2  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
ccmin-mode := 2  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
rfirst := 100  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing is important for performance
verb := '1'  # Keep this value as it controls verbosity
rcheck := 'False'  # Disable restart checks to save time
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking is not necessary here
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination is important for performance
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Keep this value as it balances between memory usage and performance
sub-lim := 1000  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
cl-lim := 20  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
grow := 0  # Keep this value as it is generally effective
```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Restart Strategy**:
   - Change `luby` to `False` and use a more efficient restart strategy like `MiniSATRestarts` or `ArminRestarts`. For example:
     ```plaintext
     restarts := 'MiniSATRestarts'
     initconflictbound := 100  # Default value
     conflictboundincfactor := 2.0  # Default value
     ```

2. **Phase Selection**:
   - Consider using a more aggressive phase selection strategy like `RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy` to potentially improve performance:
     ```plaintext
     phase := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
     ```

3. **Simplification**:
   - Ensure that the simplification level is set to an appropriate level. If `EXPENSIVE_SIMPLIFICATION` is too costly, consider using `SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION`:
     ```plaintext
     simp := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
     ```

4. **Clause Cleaning**:
   - Ensure that the clause cleaning strategy is set to `LBD2` as required by `Glucose21Restarts`:
     ```plaintext
     cleaning := 'LBD2'
     ```

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
restarts := 'MiniSATRestarts'
initconflictbound := 100
conflictboundincfactor := 2.0
phase := 'RSATLastLearnedClausesPhaseSelectionStrategy'
simp := 'SIMPLE_SIMPLIFICATION'
cleaning := 'LBD2'

luby := 'False'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 2.0
var-decay := 0.95
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
```

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system.
