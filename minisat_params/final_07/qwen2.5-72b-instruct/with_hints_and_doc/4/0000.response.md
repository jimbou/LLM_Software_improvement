To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that significantly impact performance, such as restart strategies, decay factors, and simplification levels. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Keep Luby restarts for adaptability
rnd-init := 'False'  # Random initialization is not necessary
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduce garbage collection frequency to improve performance
rinc := 1.5  # Lower the conflict bound increase factor for faster convergence
var-decay := 0.9  # Slightly decrease variable activity decay for better learning
cla-decay := 0.995  # Slightly decrease clause activity decay for better learning
rnd-freq := 0.0  # No random frequency needed
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Keep the same seed for reproducibility
phase-saving := 2  # Keep phase saving level for efficiency
ccmin-mode := 2  # Keep clause cleaning mode for efficiency
rfirst := 50  # Lower the initial conflict bound for faster restarts
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing is beneficial
verb := '1'  # Keep verbosity for monitoring
rcheck := 'False'  # Redundancy checks are not necessary
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking is not necessary
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination can help
simp-gc-frac := 0.5  # Keep the simplification garbage collection fraction
sub-lim := 500  # Lower the subsumption limit for faster processing
cl-lim := 10  # Lower the clause limit for faster processing
grow := 0  # No growth factor needed
```

### Explanation:
1. **Restart Strategy (`luby`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `True`
   - **Reason**: Luby restarts are adaptive and generally perform well across a variety of problems. Keeping this enabled helps the solver adapt to different problem characteristics.

2. **Garbage Collection Fraction (`gc-frac`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.1`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the garbage collection frequency can improve performance by reducing overhead. However, it should not be too low to avoid memory issues.

3. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor (`rinc`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`
   - **Reason**: A lower value for the conflict bound increase factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help the solver escape local minima more quickly.

4. **Variable Activity Decay (`var-decay`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`
   - **Reason**: Slightly decreasing the variable activity decay can help the solver learn more effectively from past conflicts, leading to better performance.

5. **Clause Activity Decay (`cla-decay`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.995`
   - **Reason**: Slightly decreasing the clause activity decay can help the solver maintain more relevant clauses, improving learning and performance.

6. **Initial Conflict Bound (`rfirst`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `50`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the initial conflict bound can lead to faster restarts, which can help the solver converge more quickly.

7. **Subsumption Limit (`sub-lim`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `500`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the subsumption limit can reduce the time spent on subsumption checks, improving overall performance.

8. **Clause Limit (`cl-lim`)**:
   - **Optimized Value**: `10`
   - **Reason**: Lowering the clause limit can reduce the number of clauses retained, which can help with memory management and speed up the solving process.

By making these adjustments, the configuration should provide better runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality of the system.
