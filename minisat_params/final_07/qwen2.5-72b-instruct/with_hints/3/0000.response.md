To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we can focus on several key parameters that are known to have a significant impact on performance in SAT solvers and similar systems. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **luby := 'True'**: Keep this as it is. The Luby sequence is often effective for restart policies.
- **rnd-init := 'False'**: This is generally fine, but if you want to introduce more randomness, you could set it to 'True'.
- **gc-frac := 0.1**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help reduce overhead.
- **rinc := 1.5**: A lower value for the restart increment can help balance between exploration and exploitation.
- **var-decay := 0.97**: Slightly increase the variable decay to make the solver less aggressive in forgetting past decisions.
- **cla-decay := 0.998**: Slightly decrease the clause decay to retain more learned clauses, which can help with convergence.
- **rnd-freq := 0.02**: Introduce a small amount of randomness to avoid getting stuck in local optima.
- **rnd-seed := 91648253**: Keep this as it is, or change it if you need different random behavior.
- **phase-saving := 1**: Reduce phase saving to speed up the initial solving process.
- **ccmin-mode := 1**: Lower the conflict clause minimization mode to reduce the overhead of clause minimization.
- **rfirst := 50**: Start with a smaller first restart interval to quickly explore the search space.
- **pre := 'True'**: Keep this as it is; preprocessing is generally beneficial.
- **verb := '0'**: Set verbosity to 0 to reduce logging overhead.
- **rcheck := 'False'**: Keep this as it is; redundant checks can slow down the solver.
- **asymm := 'False'**: Keep this as it is; symmetry breaking is not always necessary.
- **elim := 'True'**: Keep this as it is; variable elimination can help simplify the problem.
- **simp-gc-frac := 0.3**: Further reduce the simplification garbage collection fraction to minimize overhead.
- **sub-lim := 500**: Reduce the subproblem limit to speed up the solving process.
- **cl-lim := 10**: Lower the clause limit to reduce memory usage and improve speed.
- **grow := 0**: Keep this as it is; no growth of the clause database is often optimal.

### Summary of Changes:
- **gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to reduce garbage collection overhead.
- **rinc**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5 to balance restarts more effectively.
- **var-decay**: Increased from 0.95 to 0.97 to retain more information about variable activity.
- **cla-decay**: Decreased from 0.999 to 0.998 to retain more learned clauses.
- **rnd-freq**: Introduced a small randomness factor (0.02) to avoid local optima.
- **phase-saving**: Reduced from 2 to 1 to speed up initial solving.
- **ccmin-mode**: Reduced from 2 to 1 to reduce clause minimization overhead.
- **rfirst**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to start with more frequent restarts.
- **verb**: Set to 0 to reduce logging overhead.
- **simp-gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 to minimize simplification garbage collection.
- **sub-lim**: Reduced from 1000 to 500 to speed up the solving process.
- **cl-lim**: Reduced from 20 to 10 to reduce memory usage and improve speed.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system.
