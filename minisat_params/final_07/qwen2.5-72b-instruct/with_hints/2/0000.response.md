To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **`gc-frac`**: This parameter controls the garbage collection fraction. A lower value can help reduce the overhead of garbage collection but might increase memory usage. A value of `0.1` is often a good balance.
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.1`

2. **`rinc`**: This parameter controls the restart increment. A higher value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can sometimes improve performance by escaping local minima. However, too high a value can lead to excessive restarts. A value of `1.5` is often a good starting point.
   - **Optimized Value**: `1.5`

3. **`var-decay`**: This parameter controls the variable decay rate. A lower value can help in focusing on more recent decisions, which can be beneficial for solving hard instances. A value of `0.9` is often a good balance.
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.9`

4. **`cla-decay`**: This parameter controls the clause decay rate. A lower value can help in keeping more clauses, which can be beneficial for learning. A value of `0.99` is often a good balance.
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.99`

5. **`rnd-freq`**: This parameter controls the frequency of random decisions. A small non-zero value can help in breaking ties and avoiding local minima. A value of `0.01` is often a good starting point.
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.01`

6. **`rfirst`**: This parameter controls the initial restart limit. A higher value can help in exploring more of the search space before the first restart. A value of `500` is often a good balance.
   - **Optimized Value**: `500`

7. **`pre`**: This parameter enables preprocessing. Preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance. Keeping it `True` is generally beneficial.
   - **Optimized Value**: `True`

8. **`elim`**: This parameter enables variable elimination. Variable elimination can simplify the problem and improve performance. Keeping it `True` is generally beneficial.
   - **Optimized Value**: `True`

9. **`simp-gc-frac`**: This parameter controls the garbage collection fraction during simplification. A lower value can help reduce the overhead of garbage collection during simplification. A value of `0.3` is often a good balance.
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.3`

10. **`sub-lim`**: This parameter controls the subproblem limit. A higher value can help in exploring more subproblems, which can be beneficial for solving hard instances. A value of `5000` is often a good starting point.
    - **Optimized Value**: `5000`

11. **`cl-lim`**: This parameter controls the clause limit. A higher value can help in keeping more clauses, which can be beneficial for learning. A value of `50` is often a good balance.
    - **Optimized Value**: `50`

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 'True'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.01
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 500
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.3
sub-lim := 5000
cl-lim := 50
grow := 0
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. Always test the optimized configuration with your specific workload to ensure it meets your performance requirements.
