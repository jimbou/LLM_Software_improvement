To optimize the given parameter configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized version of the parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **luby**: `True` (Keep as is; Luby restarts can help in solving hard instances more efficiently.)
- **rnd-init**: `False` (Keep as is; random initialization is not typically necessary for most SAT solvers.)
- **gc-frac**: `0.1` (Reducing the garbage collection fraction can improve performance by reducing the frequency of garbage collection.)
- **rinc**: `1.5` (A slightly lower value can help in more controlled restarts, potentially leading to faster convergence.)
- **var-decay**: `0.9` (A slightly lower decay factor can help in more aggressive variable activity updates, which can speed up the search process.)
- **cla-decay**: `0.998` (A slightly lower decay factor can help in more aggressive clause activity updates, which can also speed up the search process.)
- **rnd-freq**: `0.05` (Introducing a small amount of randomness can help escape local minima and potentially find solutions faster.)
- **rnd-seed**: `91648253` (Keep as is; changing the seed might affect reproducibility but not necessarily performance.)
- **phase-saving**: `1` (Reducing phase saving can help in faster restarts and potentially faster convergence.)
- **ccmin-mode**: `2` (Keep as is; this mode is generally effective for most problems.)
- **rfirst**: `50` (Reducing the initial restart limit can help in faster initial convergence.)
- **pre**: `True` (Keep as is; preprocessing is crucial for reducing the problem size.)
- **verb**: `0` (Setting verbosity to 0 can reduce overhead from logging and improve performance.)
- **rcheck**: `False` (Keep as is; redundant checks can slow down the solver.)
- **asymm**: `False` (Keep as is; symmetry breaking is not always beneficial and can add overhead.)
- **elim**: `True` (Keep as is; variable elimination can significantly reduce the problem size.)
- **simp-gc-frac**: `0.3` (A slightly higher value can help in more frequent simplification garbage collection, which can improve performance.)
- **sub-lim**: `500` (Reducing the subproblem limit can help in faster convergence by limiting the depth of the search.)
- **cl-lim**: `10` (Reducing the clause limit can help in faster convergence by limiting the number of clauses added.)
- **grow**: `0` (Keep as is; no growth factor is typically good for most problems.)

### Summary of Changes:
1. **gc-frac**: Reduced from `0.2` to `0.1` to reduce garbage collection frequency.
2. **rinc**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.5` for more controlled restarts.
3. **var-decay**: Reduced from `0.95` to `0.9` for more aggressive variable activity updates.
4. **cla-decay**: Reduced from `0.999` to `0.998` for more aggressive clause activity updates.
5. **rnd-freq**: Increased from `0.0` to `0.05` to introduce some randomness.
6. **phase-saving**: Reduced from `2` to `1` for faster restarts.
7. **rfirst**: Reduced from `100` to `50` for faster initial convergence.
8. **verb**: Set to `0` to reduce logging overhead.
9. **simp-gc-frac**: Increased from `0.5` to `0.3` for more frequent simplification garbage collection.
10. **sub-lim**: Reduced from `1000` to `500` to limit the depth of the search.
11. **cl-lim**: Reduced from `20` to `10` to limit the number of clauses added.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the effectiveness of the solver.
