To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are some suggestions:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **luby (Restart Strategy)**
   - **Current:** `True`
   - **Optimized:** `False`
   - **Reason:** The Luby restart strategy can be effective in certain scenarios but often leads to more frequent restarts, which can increase overhead. Disabling it might help in reducing unnecessary restarts and improving overall performance.

2. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction)**
   - **Current:** `0.2`
   - **Optimized:** `0.1`
   - **Reason:** A lower garbage collection fraction can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which can improve performance by reducing overhead. However, it's important to monitor memory usage to ensure it doesn't lead to excessive memory consumption.

3. **rinc (Restart Increment)**
   - **Current:** `2.0`
   - **Optimized:** `1.5`
   - **Reason:** A smaller increment can help in finding a good solution faster by allowing more frequent adjustments to the restart strategy without being too aggressive.

4. **var-decay (Variable Activity Decay)**
   - **Current:** `0.95`
   - **Optimized:** `0.97`
   - **Reason:** Increasing the decay factor slightly can help in maintaining a more stable activity score for variables, which can lead to better decision-making and potentially faster convergence.

5. **cla-decay (Clause Activity Decay)**
   - **Current:** `0.999`
   - **Optimized:** `0.995`
   - **Reason:** Reducing the clause activity decay slightly can help in maintaining a more dynamic view of clause activities, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on relevant clauses.

6. **rnd-freq (Random Frequency)**
   - **Current:** `0.0`
   - **Optimized:** `0.01`
   - **Reason:** Introducing a small amount of randomness can help in escaping local minima and potentially finding better solutions faster.

7. **ccmin-mode (Component Clause Minimization Mode)**
   - **Current:** `2`
   - **Optimized:** `1`
   - **Reason:** Mode 1 is generally less aggressive and can be more efficient in terms of runtime performance while still providing good results.

8. **rfirst (First Restart Limit)**
   - **Current:** `100`
   - **Optimized:** `50`
   - **Reason:** Reducing the first restart limit can help in finding a solution faster by allowing the solver to make more frequent decisions early on.

9. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction)**
   - **Current:** `0.5`
   - **Optimized:** `0.3`
   - **Reason:** A lower fraction can reduce the frequency of garbage collection during simplification, which can improve performance by reducing overhead.

10. **sub-lim (Subsumption Limit)**
    - **Current:** `1000`
    - **Optimized:** `500`
    - **Reason:** Reducing the subsumption limit can help in reducing the computational effort spent on subsumption checks, which can improve performance.

11. **cl-lim (Clause Length Limit)**
    - **Current:** `20`
    - **Optimized:** `30`
    - **Reason:** Increasing the clause length limit slightly can help in capturing more complex relationships between variables, which can lead to better performance in some cases.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
luby := 'False'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.97
cla-decay := 0.995
rnd-freq := 0.01
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 1
rfirst := 50
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.3
sub-lim := 500
cl-lim := 30
grow := 0
```

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system. It's always a good idea to test these configurations with your specific workload to ensure they provide the desired performance improvements.
