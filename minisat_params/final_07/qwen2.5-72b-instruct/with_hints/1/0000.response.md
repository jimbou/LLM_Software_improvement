To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters based on common practices and empirical evidence in SAT solving:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **luby** := 'True' (Keep as is; Luby restarts often improve performance)
- **rnd-init** := 'False' (Keep as is; random initialization can sometimes degrade performance)
- **gc-frac** := 0.1 (Reducing garbage collection frequency can improve performance by reducing overhead)
- **rinc** := 1.5 (Lowering the restart increment can help in finding solutions faster)
- **var-decay** := 0.9 (Slightly reducing variable decay can help in focusing on more relevant variables)
- **cla-decay** := 0.99 (Slightly reducing clause decay can help in maintaining a more useful set of learned clauses)
- **rnd-freq** := 0.05 (Introducing a small amount of randomness can help escape local minima)
- **rnd-seed** := 91648253 (Keep as is; seed is less critical for performance)
- **phase-saving** := 1 (Reducing phase saving can help in faster convergence)
- **ccmin-mode** := 2 (Keep as is; this mode is generally effective)
- **rfirst** := 50 (Reducing the initial restart limit can help in quicker initial progress)
- **pre** := 'True' (Preprocessing is crucial for performance and should be kept enabled)
- **verb** := '0' (Reducing verbosity can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations)
- **rcheck** := 'False' (Keep as is; redundant checks can slow down the solver)
- **asymm** := 'False' (Asymmetry breaking is not always beneficial and can be computationally expensive)
- **elim** := 'True' (Variable elimination is important for performance and should be kept enabled)
- **simp-gc-frac** := 0.3 (Balancing the garbage collection fraction can help in managing memory usage)
- **sub-lim** := 500 (Reducing the subproblem limit can help in managing complexity)
- **cl-lim** := 10 (Reducing the clause limit can help in managing the size of the problem)
- **grow** := 0 (Keep as is; growing the clause database can lead to increased memory usage)

### Explanation:
1. **gc-frac**: Reducing from 0.2 to 0.1 can significantly reduce the overhead of garbage collection.
2. **rinc**: Lowering from 2.0 to 1.5 can help in more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial in finding solutions faster.
3. **var-decay**: Slightly reducing from 0.95 to 0.9 can help in focusing on more relevant variables.
4. **cla-decay**: Slightly reducing from 0.999 to 0.99 can help in maintaining a more useful set of learned clauses.
5. **rnd-freq**: Introducing a small amount of randomness (0.05) can help in escaping local minima.
6. **phase-saving**: Reducing from 2 to 1 can help in faster convergence.
7. **rfirst**: Reducing from 100 to 50 can help in quicker initial progress.
8. **verb**: Reducing from 1 to 0 can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.
9. **simp-gc-frac**: Balancing from 0.5 to 0.3 can help in managing memory usage.
10. **sub-lim**: Reducing from 1000 to 500 can help in managing the complexity of subproblems.
11. **cl-lim**: Reducing from 20 to 10 can help in managing the size of the problem.

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining the overall functionality of the system.
