To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on parameters that significantly affect the solver's efficiency and resource utilization. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **luby (Luby Restart Strategy)**: Setting `luby := 'True'` can help in breaking long sequences of bad decisions, but it might also lead to more frequent restarts, which can be costly. This is generally beneficial for hard problems but might not be optimal for all cases.

2. **rnd-init (Random Initialization)**: Setting `rnd-init := 'False'` means the solver starts with a deterministic state. Enabling random initialization (`rnd-init := 'True'`) can sometimes help in finding solutions faster by avoiding local minima.

3. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction)**: The value `gc-frac := 0.2` determines the fraction of variables to garbage collect. A higher value can reduce memory usage but might slow down the solver. A lower value can speed up the solver but at the cost of increased memory usage.

4. **rinc (Restart Increment)**: The value `rinc := 2.0` controls how quickly the restart interval increases. A higher value can lead to fewer but longer runs between restarts, which might be beneficial for very hard problems.

5. **var-decay (Variable Activity Decay)**: The value `var-decay := 0.95` affects how quickly the activity of variables decays. A lower value can make the solver more sensitive to recent conflicts, which can help in finding solutions faster.

6. **cla-decay (Clause Activity Decay)**: The value `cla-decay := 0.999` affects how quickly the activity of clauses decays. A lower value can make the solver more sensitive to recent conflicts, similar to `var-decay`.

7. **rnd-freq (Random Frequency)**: The value `rnd-freq := 0.0` means no random decisions are made. Introducing some randomness (`rnd-freq > 0.0`) can help in exploring the search space more effectively.

8. **phase-saving (Phase Saving Level)**: The value `phase-saving := 2` saves the phase of literals more aggressively. This can help in reducing the number of conflicts but might also lead to more redundant work.

9. **ccmin-mode (Clause Cleaning Mode)**: The value `ccmin-mode := 2` enables aggressive clause cleaning, which can reduce memory usage but might also remove useful clauses.

10. **rfirst (First Restart Interval)**: The value `rfirst := 100` sets the initial restart interval. A lower value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in breaking out of local minima.

11. **pre (Preprocessing)**: The value `pre := 'True'` enables preprocessing, which can significantly reduce the problem size before solving. This is generally beneficial.

12. **verb (Verbosity Level)**: The value `verb := '1'` sets the verbosity level. Higher values can provide more detailed output but can also slow down the solver.

13. **rcheck (Restart Check)**: The value `rcheck := 'False'` disables checks for redundant restarts. Enabling this (`rcheck := 'True'`) can help in avoiding unnecessary restarts.

14. **asymm (Asymmetric Branching)**: The value `asymm := 'False'` disables asymmetric branching, which can sometimes lead to more efficient search.

15. **elim (Variable Elimination)**: The value `elim := 'True'` enables variable elimination, which can reduce the problem size and improve performance.

16. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction)**: The value `simp-gc-frac := 0.5` determines the fraction of variables to garbage collect during simplification. A higher value can reduce memory usage but might slow down the solver.

17. **sub-lim (Subsumption Limit)**: The value `sub-lim := 1000` limits the number of subsumption checks. A higher value can lead to more thorough subsumption but can also slow down the solver.

18. **cl-lim (Clause Length Limit)**: The value `cl-lim := 20` limits the length of learned clauses. A higher value can lead to more complex clauses, which can be beneficial for hard problems but can also slow down the solver.

19. **grow (Clause Growth Factor)**: The value `grow := 0` disables clause growth. Enabling this (`grow > 0`) can help in learning more complex clauses, which can improve performance for hard problems.

### Step 2: Suggest Specific Adjustments

Based on the analysis, here are the suggested adjustments:

1. **Enable Random Initialization**: Set `rnd-init := 'True'` to introduce some randomness and avoid local minima.
2. **Adjust Garbage Collection Fraction**: Increase `gc-frac` to `0.3` to balance memory usage and performance.
3. **Increase Restart Increment**: Set `rinc := 1.5` to balance the frequency of restarts.
4. **Introduce Random Decisions**: Set `rnd-freq := 0.05` to explore the search space more effectively.
5. **Reduce Phase Saving Aggressiveness**: Set `phase-saving := 1` to reduce redundant work.
6. **Enable Restart Check**: Set `rcheck := 'True'` to avoid unnecessary restarts.
7. **Enable Asymmetric Branching**: Set `asymm := 'True'` to potentially improve search efficiency.
8. **Adjust Clause Growth Factor**: Set `grow := 1` to enable clause growth and learn more complex clauses.
9. **Reduce Subsumption Limit**: Set `sub-lim := 500` to balance thoroughness and performance.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

Here is the optimized configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 'True'
rnd-init := 'True'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.95
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.05
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 1
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'True'
asymm := 'True'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 500
cl-lim := 20
grow := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Random Initialization (`rnd-init := 'True'`)**: Helps in breaking out of local minima and can lead to faster convergence.
2. **Garbage Collection Fraction (`gc-frac := 0.3`)**: Balances memory usage and performance by allowing more frequent garbage collection.
3. **Restart Increment (`rinc := 1.5`)**: Reduces the frequency of restarts, which can be more efficient for many problems.
4. **Random Decisions (`rnd-freq := 0.05`)**: Introduces some randomness to explore the search space more thoroughly.
5. **Phase Saving Aggressiveness (`phase-saving := 1`)**: Reduces redundant work by being less aggressive in saving phases.
6. **Restart Check (`rcheck := 'True'`)**: Avoids unnecessary restarts, which can save computational resources.
7. **Asymmetric Branching (`asymm := 'True'`)**: Potentially improves search efficiency by making more informed branching decisions.
8. **Clause Growth Factor (`grow := 1`)**: Enables learning more complex clauses, which can be beneficial for hard problems.
9. **Subsumption Limit (`sub-lim := 500`)**: Balances the thoroughness of subsumption checks with performance.

These changes should help in improving the runtime performance of the solver while maintaining its effectiveness in solving the problem.
