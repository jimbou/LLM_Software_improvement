To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on performance. Here are the key parameters and suggested adjustments:

1. **`gc-frac`**: This parameter controls the garbage collection frequency. A lower value can reduce the overhead of frequent garbage collection but might increase memory usage. A higher value can lead to more frequent garbage collection, which can be costly in terms of runtime.

   - **Suggestion**: Increase `gc-frac` slightly to 0.3 to balance between memory usage and garbage collection overhead.

2. **`rinc`**: This parameter controls the rate at which the restart interval increases. A higher value can lead to fewer restarts, which can be beneficial for certain types of problems but might not be optimal for all.

   - **Suggestion**: Keep `rinc` at 2.0 as it is generally a good balance.

3. **`var-decay` and `cla-decay`**: These parameters control the decay rates for variable and clause activities, respectively. Lower values can help the solver adapt more quickly to changes in the problem, but too low values can lead to instability.

   - **Suggestion**: Keep `var-decay` at 0.95 and `cla-decay` at 0.999 as they are well-balanced values.

4. **`rnd-freq`**: This parameter controls the frequency of random decisions. Setting it to 0 disables random decisions, which can be beneficial for deterministic behavior but might not always lead to the best performance.

   - **Suggestion**: Set `rnd-freq` to 0.05 to introduce a small amount of randomness, which can help escape local minima.

5. **`ccmin-mode`**: This parameter controls conflict clause minimization. Higher values can lead to more aggressive minimization, which can improve performance but also increase computational overhead.

   - **Suggestion**: Keep `ccmin-mode` at 2 as it provides a good balance between performance and overhead.

6. **`rfirst`**: This parameter sets the initial restart interval. A lower value can lead to more frequent restarts, which can be beneficial for some problems but might not be optimal for others.

   - **Suggestion**: Set `rfirst` to 50 to reduce the initial restart interval, which can help the solver explore the search space more quickly.

7. **`simp-gc-frac`**: This parameter controls the garbage collection fraction during simplification. A higher value can lead to more frequent garbage collection, which can be costly.

   - **Suggestion**: Keep `simp-gc-frac` at 0.5 as it is a reasonable balance.

8. **`sub-lim` and `cl-lim`**: These parameters control the subsumption limit and clause limit, respectively. Lower values can reduce the computational overhead but might also reduce the effectiveness of the solver.

   - **Suggestion**: Set `sub-lim` to 500 and `cl-lim` to 10 to strike a balance between performance and effectiveness.

9. **`elim`**: This parameter enables variable elimination, which can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance.

   - **Suggestion**: Keep `elim` set to 'True' as it is generally beneficial.

10. **`pre`**: This parameter enables preprocessing, which can simplify the problem before solving and improve performance.

    - **Suggestion**: Keep `pre` set to 'True' as it is generally beneficial.

### Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.3
rinc := 2.0
var-decay := 0.95
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.05
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 500

```

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance of your system while maintaining its functionality.
