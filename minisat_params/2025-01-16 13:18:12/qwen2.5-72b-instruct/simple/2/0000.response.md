To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency in a SAT solver (assuming this is the context based on the parameters provided), we need to consider the trade-offs between solving speed and solution quality. Here are some adjustments and explanations:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'True'  # Luby restart strategy is generally efficient.
rnd-init := 'False'  # Random initialization can sometimes slow down the solver.
gc-frac := 0.1  # Reduce garbage collection frequency to improve performance.
rinc := 1.5  # A slightly lower increment factor can help with faster convergence.
var-decay := 0.9  # Slightly increase variable decay to reduce memory overhead.
cla-decay := 0.99  # Slightly increase clause decay to manage memory better.
rnd-freq := 0.01  # Introduce a small amount of randomness to avoid getting stuck in local optima.
rnd-seed := 91648253  # Keep the same seed for reproducibility.
phase-saving := 2  # Phase saving helps in maintaining good solutions.
ccmin-mode := 2  # Conflict clause minimization mode 2 is usually effective.
rfirst := 50  # Start with a smaller initial restart value to find solutions faster.
pre := 'True'  # Preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size.
verb := '0'  # Reduce verbosity to minimize I/O overhead.
rcheck := 'False'  # Redundancy checks can be expensive.
asymm := 'False'  # Asymmetry breaking can be complex and slow.
elim := 'True'  # Variable elimination can simplify the problem.
simp-gc-frac := 0.4  # Adjust garbage collection fraction for better balance.
sub-lim := 500  # Lower the subproblem limit to reduce overhead.
cl-lim := 10  # Lower the clause limit to manage memory better.
grow := 0  # No growth factor needed for most problems.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Luby Restart Strategy (`luby := 'True'`)**: This strategy is known for its effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation.
2. **Garbage Collection Fraction (`gc-frac := 0.1`)**: Reducing the garbage collection frequency can improve performance by reducing the overhead of memory management.
3. **Restart Increment Factor (`rinc := 1.5`)**: A slightly lower increment factor can help the solver converge faster.
4. **Variable Decay (`var-decay := 0.9`)**: Increasing the decay rate slightly can help in managing memory more efficiently.
5. **Clause Decay (`cla-decay := 0.99`)**: Similarly, increasing the clause decay rate can help manage memory better.
6. **Random Frequency (`rnd-freq := 0.01`)**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help the solver escape local optima.
7. **Verbosity (`verb := '0'`)**: Reducing verbosity can minimize I/O overhead, which can be significant in large problems.
8. **Initial Restart Value (`rfirst := 50`)**: Starting with a smaller initial restart value can help find solutions faster.
9. **Subproblem Limit (`sub-lim := 500`)**: Lowering the subproblem limit can reduce overhead and improve performance.
10. **Clause Limit (`cl-lim := 10`)**: Lowering the clause limit can help manage memory better, especially for large problems.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime efficiency of the SAT solver while maintaining the quality of the solutions.
