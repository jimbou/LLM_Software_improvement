To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we can make several adjustments based on the provided documentation and the typical best practices for SAT solvers. Hereâ€™s an optimized set of parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **luby** := 'False'  
  - **Reason**: Disabling the Luby restart strategy can sometimes lead to better performance, especially if the problem instance benefits from more continuous search without frequent restarts.
- **rnd-init** := 'False'  
  - **Reason**: Random initialization is generally not necessary unless you have specific reasons to believe it helps with the particular problem instance.
- **gc-frac** := 0.1  
  - **Reason**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can help reduce overhead, but it should still be high enough to prevent excessive memory usage.
- **rinc** := 1.5  
  - **Reason**: A lower increment factor for the conflict bound can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima more effectively.
- **var-decay** := 0.9  
  - **Reason**: A slightly lower variable activity decay can help the solver focus more on recently active variables, potentially improving convergence.
- **cla-decay** := 0.995  
  - **Reason**: Slightly reducing the clause activity decay can help maintain a balance between recent and older clauses, which can be beneficial for certain problem instances.
- **rnd-freq** := 0.05  
  - **Reason**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help the solver explore different parts of the search space, which can be useful for hard problems.
- **rnd-seed** := 91648253  
  - **Reason**: Keeping the same random seed ensures reproducibility, which is important for debugging and benchmarking.
- **phase-saving** := 1  
  - **Reason**: Phase saving at level 1 is often sufficient and can reduce the overhead associated with higher levels.
- **ccmin-mode** := 1  
  - **Reason**: A less aggressive clause cleaning mode can help reduce the computational cost of cleaning, while still maintaining a reasonable level of clause management.
- **rfirst** := 50  
  - **Reason**: Starting with a lower initial conflict bound can help the solver converge faster in the early stages.
- **pre** := 'True'  
  - **Reason**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial as it can simplify the problem before the main solving process.
- **verb** := '0'  
  - **Reason**: Reducing verbosity can help reduce I/O overhead, which can improve performance.
- **rcheck** := 'False'  
  - **Reason**: Restart checking is generally not necessary unless you suspect issues with the restart strategy.
- **asymm** := 'False'  
  - **Reason**: Asymmetry breaking is not always beneficial and can add unnecessary complexity.
- **elim** := 'True'  
  - **Reason**: Variable elimination can simplify the problem and reduce the search space, which is generally beneficial.
- **simp-gc-frac** := 0.4  
  - **Reason**: A slightly lower garbage collection fraction during simplification can help reduce overhead.
- **sub-lim** := 500  
  - **Reason**: Reducing the subsumption limit can help reduce the computational cost of subsumption checks, which can be expensive.
- **cl-lim** := 10  
  - **Reason**: Reducing the clause limit can help prevent the solver from keeping too many clauses, which can slow down the search.
- **grow** := 0  
  - **Reason**: Keeping this at 0 maintains the default behavior, which is usually sufficient.

### Summary of Changes:
- **Restart Strategy**: Changed from Luby to a non-Luby strategy to potentially reduce the overhead of frequent restarts.
- **Garbage Collection**: Reduced fractions to minimize overhead while maintaining memory efficiency.
- **Conflict Bound Increment**: Lowered to allow more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima.
- **Activity Decay Factors**: Adjusted to balance recent and older activities.
- **Randomness**: Introduced a small amount to explore the search space more effectively.
- **Preprocessing and Simplification**: Kept enabled to simplify the problem and reduce the search space.
- **Verbosity**: Reduced to minimize I/O overhead.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of the solver while maintaining its ability to solve the problem effectively.
