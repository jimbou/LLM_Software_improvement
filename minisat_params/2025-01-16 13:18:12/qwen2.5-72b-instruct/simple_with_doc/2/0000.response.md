To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully consider the impact of each parameter on the solver's performance. Here are some adjustments based on common best practices and the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **RESTARTS**:
   - **Current**: LubyRestarts (implied by `luby := 'True'`)
   - **Optimized**: LubyRestarts (keep as is, but adjust LUBYFACTOR)
   - **Reason**: Luby restarts are generally effective, but the LUBYFACTOR can be fine-tuned for better performance.

2. **LUBYFACTOR**:
   - **Current**: Not explicitly set (default is 512)
   - **Optimized**: 256
   - **Reason**: A lower LUBYFACTOR can help the solver converge faster in some cases.

3. **GC_FRAC**:
   - **Current**: 0.2
   - **Optimized**: 0.1
   - **Reason**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can reduce overhead and improve performance.

4. **RINC**:
   - **Current**: 2.0
   - **Optimized**: 1.5
   - **Reason**: A lower increment factor can help in more frequent restarts, which can sometimes lead to faster convergence.

5. **VAR_DECAY**:
   - **Current**: 0.95
   - **Optimized**: 0.9
   - **Reason**: A slightly lower decay factor can help in more aggressive variable activity updates, potentially leading to better performance.

6. **CLA_DECAY**:
   - **Current**: 0.999
   - **Optimized**: 0.99
   - **Reason**: A slightly lower decay factor can help in more aggressive clause activity updates, potentially leading to better performance.

7. **RND_FREQ**:
   - **Current**: 0.0
   - **Optimized**: 0.05
   - **Reason**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help escape local minima and improve performance.

8. **PRE**:
   - **Current**: True
   - **Optimized**: True (keep as is)
   - **Reason**: Preprocessing is generally beneficial and should be kept enabled.

9. **ELIM**:
   - **Current**: True
   - **Optimized**: True (keep as is)
   - **Reason**: Variable elimination can significantly simplify the problem and improve performance.

10. **SIMP_GC_FRAC**:
    - **Current**: 0.5
    - **Optimized**: 0.4
    - **Reason**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction during simplification can reduce overhead and improve performance.

11. **SUB_LIM**:
    - **Current**: 1000
    - **Optimized**: 500
    - **Reason**: A lower subsumption limit can reduce the time spent on subsumption checks, potentially improving performance.

12. **CL_LIM**:
    - **Current**: 20
    - **Optimized**: 10
    - **Reason**: A lower clause limit can reduce the number of clauses stored, potentially improving performance.

13. **GROW**:
    - **Current**: 0
    - **Optimized**: 0 (keep as is)
    - **Reason**: No growth factor is typically a good default unless specific problem characteristics suggest otherwise.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
luby := 'True'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.1
rinc := 1.5
var-decay := 0.9
cla-decay := 0.99
rnd-freq := 0.05
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.4
sub-lim := 500
cl-lim := 10
grow := 0
```

These changes aim to balance the trade-offs between computational overhead and the effectiveness of the solver's strategies, leading to improved runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality.
