To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These typically include restart strategies, decay factors, and simplification levels. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Disable Luby restarts as they can be less efficient.
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 1.5      # Reduce the conflict bound increase factor for faster convergence.
var-decay := 0.9 # Slightly reduce the variable activity decay to maintain good variable selection.
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 50     # Lower the initial conflict bound for quicker restarts.
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **luby := 'False'**
   - Disabling Luby restarts can sometimes lead to faster solving times, especially for problems where the Luby sequence does not provide a significant advantage. This change is based on the observation that Luby restarts can sometimes introduce unnecessary overhead.

2. **rinc := 1.5**
   - Reducing the conflict bound increase factor from 2.0 to 1.5 can help the solver converge more quickly. A lower value means the conflict bound increases more gradually, potentially leading to more frequent and effective restarts.

3. **var-decay := 0.9**
   - Slightly reducing the variable activity decay from 0.95 to 0.9 can help the solver maintain a more dynamic variable selection, which can be beneficial for certain problem types.

4. **rfirst := 50**
   - Lowering the initial conflict bound from 100 to 50 can help the solver start with more frequent restarts, which can be useful for quickly identifying and resolving conflicts early in the solving process.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Restart Strategy**: If you find that the problem type benefits from a different restart strategy, you might want to experiment with `MiniSATRestarts` or `ArminRestarts`. For example, setting `restarts := 'MiniSATRestarts'` and adjusting `initConflictBound` and `conflictBoundIncFactor` accordingly could be beneficial.
- **Simplification Level**: The current configuration uses `pre := 'True'` and `elim := 'True'`, which are good for most cases. However, if you encounter very large instances, you might consider setting `pre := 'False'` to reduce preprocessing time, although this could affect the overall solving efficiency.

By making these adjustments, you should see an improvement in runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system.
