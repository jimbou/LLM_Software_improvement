To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These typically include the restart strategy, decay factors, and simplification levels. Hereâ€™s an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Disable Luby restarts as they can be more time-consuming.
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 1.5      # Lower the conflict bound increase factor to reduce the rate of growth.
var-decay := 0.97  # Increase the variable decay factor slightly to retain more recent activity information.
cla-decay := 0.999
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 100
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
restarts := 'Glucose21Restarts'  # Use Glucose21 restarts for a balance between performance and effectiveness.
cleaning := 'LBD2'               # Use LBD2 cleaning strategy as it is compatible with Glucose21 restarts.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Restart Strategy (`restarts`)**:
   - Changed from `LubyRestarts` to `Glucose21Restarts`. Luby restarts can be more computationally expensive due to their non-linear nature. Glucose21 restarts provide a good balance between performance and effectiveness.

2. **Conflict Bound Increase Factor (`rinc`)**:
   - Reduced from 2.0 to 1.5. This reduces the rate at which the conflict bound grows, potentially leading to more frequent but less aggressive restarts, which can improve performance.

3. **Variable Decay Factor (`var-decay`)**:
   - Increased from 0.95 to 0.97. A slightly higher decay factor retains more recent activity information, which can help in making better decisions during the search process.

4. **Cleaning Strategy (`cleaning`)**:
   - Set to `LBD2` to maintain compatibility with `Glucose21Restarts`. LBD2 is generally efficient and helps in keeping the clause database clean without excessive overhead.

5. **Luby Factor (`luby`)**:
   - Disabled by setting `luby` to `False`. Since we are using `Glucose21Restarts`, this parameter is not applicable and can be ignored.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Simplification Level (`pre` and `elim`)**:
  - Both `pre` and `elim` are kept enabled (`True`) to ensure that the solver performs necessary preprocessing and variable elimination, which can significantly reduce the problem size and improve performance.

- **Verbosity (`verb`)**:
  - Kept at 1 to maintain a reasonable level of output for debugging and monitoring, without overwhelming the logs.

By making these adjustments, the configuration should achieve better runtime performance while still maintaining the necessary functionality and robustness of the solver.
