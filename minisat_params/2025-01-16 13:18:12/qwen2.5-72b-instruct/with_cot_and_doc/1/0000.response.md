To optimize the given configuration, we need to focus on parameters that have a significant impact on runtime performance. These typically include the restart strategy, decay factors, and simplification levels. Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **Restart Strategy (`luby`)**: The current setting is `True`, which implies the use of the Luby restart strategy. This is generally effective but can be tuned further.
2. **Decay Factors**:
   - `var-decay`: 0.95 (Variable activity decay)
   - `cla-decay`: 0.999 (Clause activity decay)
3. **Simplification (`pre` and `elim`)**: Both are set to `True`, which means expensive simplifications are being performed.
4. **Conflict Bound and Increase Factor**:
   - `rfirst`: 100 (Initial conflict bound)
   - `rinc`: 2.0 (Conflict bound increase factor)
5. **Clause Cleaning (`ccmin-mode`)**: Set to 2, which is a more aggressive cleaning strategy.
6. **Phase Saving (`phase-saving`)**: Set to 2, which is a moderate level of phase saving.

### Step 2: Suggest Adjustments

1. **Restart Strategy**:
   - Consider switching from `LubyRestarts` to `Glucose21Restarts` or `MiniSATRestarts`. `Glucose21Restarts` is known for its effectiveness in many scenarios.
   - If `Glucose21Restarts` is chosen, ensure `cleaning` is set to `LBD` or `LBD2`.

2. **Decay Factors**:
   - **Variable Decay (`var-decay`)**: Lowering this slightly can help in focusing more on recent activities, potentially improving performance. Try setting it to 0.9.
   - **Clause Decay (`cla-decay`)**: Similarly, lowering this can help in reducing the influence of older clauses. Try setting it to 0.99.

3. **Simplification**:
   - **Preprocessing (`pre`)**: Keep it `True` as preprocessing can significantly reduce the problem size.
   - **Elimination (`elim`)**: Keep it `True` for the same reason.

4. **Conflict Bound and Increase Factor**:
   - **Initial Conflict Bound (`rfirst`)**: Increasing this slightly can help in finding a solution faster. Try setting it to 150.
   - **Conflict Bound Increase Factor (`rinc`)**: Keep it at 2.0 as it is a good balance.

5. **Clause Cleaning**:
   - **Cleaning Mode (`ccmin-mode`)**: Keep it at 2 for aggressive cleaning.

6. **Phase Saving**:
   - **Phase Saving Level (`phase-saving`)**: Keep it at 2 for a balanced approach.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
luby := 'False'  # Switch to Glucose21Restarts
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 2.0
var-decay := 0.9  # Lower variable decay
cla-decay := 0.99  # Lower clause decay
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 150  # Increase initial conflict bound
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Restart Strategy**: Switching to `Glucose21Restarts` can provide better performance in many cases due to its adaptive nature.
2. **Decay Factors**: Lowering the decay factors helps in focusing more on recent activities and clauses, which can lead to faster convergence.
3. **Conflict Bound**: Increasing the initial conflict bound can help in finding a solution faster by allowing more conflicts before the first restart.
4. **Simplification and Cleaning**: Keeping the simplification and cleaning settings ensures that the problem is reduced effectively, leading to better performance.

These adjustments should help in optimizing the runtime performance of the algorithm.
