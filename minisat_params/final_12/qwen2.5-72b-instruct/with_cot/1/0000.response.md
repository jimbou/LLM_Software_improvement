### Explanation of Changes:

1. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction):** Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1. A lower `gc-frac` can reduce the frequency of garbage collection, which might help in reducing overhead and improving performance, especially in scenarios where memory usage is not extremely high.

2. **var-decay (Variable Decay Rate):** Adjusted from 0.95 to 0.9. A slightly lower decay rate can help in maintaining more relevant variables in the search, potentially leading to faster convergence.

3. **cla-decay (Clause Decay Rate):** Slightly reduced from 0.999 to 0.998. This adjustment can help in retaining more useful clauses while still allowing for some pruning to prevent the solver from getting bogged down by too many clauses.

4. **rnd-freq (Random Frequency):** Increased from 0.0 to 0.02. Introducing a small amount of randomness can help in escaping local minima and potentially finding better solutions faster.

5. **rfirst (Initial Restart Interval):** Reduced from 100 to 50. A smaller initial restart interval can help the solver explore different parts of the search space more quickly, potentially leading to faster convergence.

6. **sub-lim (Substitution Limit):** Reduced from 1000 to 500. Lowering this limit can reduce the time spent on substitutions, which might be beneficial if the problem size allows it.

7. **cl-lim (Clause Limit):** Reduced from 20 to 10. A lower clause limit can help in keeping the problem manageable and potentially speed up the solving process, especially if the solver is dealing with a large number of clauses.

8. **simp-gc-frac (Simplification Garbage Collection Fraction):** Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4. Similar to `gc-frac`, a lower value can reduce the overhead associated with garbage collection during simplification.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and potentially speed up the solver's runtime performance.
