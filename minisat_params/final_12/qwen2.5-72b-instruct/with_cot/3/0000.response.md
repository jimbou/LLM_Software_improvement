### Explanation of Changes:
1. **luby := 'False'**: The Luby restart strategy can sometimes lead to longer runtimes for certain problems. Disabling it might help the solver converge faster on solutions.
2. **gc-frac := 0.1**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can decrease the frequency of garbage collection, potentially reducing overhead and improving runtime performance.
3. **rinc := 1.5**: Lowering the restart increment can help the solver explore the search space more effectively, leading to faster convergence.
4. **var-decay := 0.9**: Decreasing the variable activity decay rate can help maintain a more stable focus on recently active variables, which can be beneficial for performance.
5. **cla-decay := 0.998**: Slightly reducing the clause activity decay rate can help maintain a balance between recent and older clauses, potentially improving the solver's ability to find solutions quickly.
6. **rnd-freq := 0.1**: Introducing a small random frequency can help escape local optima and potentially find better solutions faster.
7. **phase-saving := 1**: Using a lower phase-saving level can reduce the overhead associated with saving phases, which can improve performance.
8. **rfirst := 50**: Reducing the initial restart interval can help the solver start exploring the search space more aggressively from the beginning.
9. **simp-gc-frac := 0.3**: Reducing the simplification garbage collection fraction can decrease the frequency of garbage collection during simplification, potentially reducing overhead.
10. **sub-lim := 500**: Lowering the subsumption limit can reduce the time spent on subsumption checks, which can be computationally expensive.
11. **cl-lim := 10**: Reducing the clause limit can help keep the clause database smaller, which can improve performance by reducing memory usage and processing time.

These changes aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, reduce overhead, and optimize the solver's behavior for faster runtime performance.
