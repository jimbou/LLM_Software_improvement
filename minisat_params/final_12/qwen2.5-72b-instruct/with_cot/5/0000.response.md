### Explanation:
1. **gc-frac (0.2 -> 0.1)**: Reducing the garbage collection fraction can reduce overhead and improve runtime by performing less frequent but more efficient garbage collection.
2. **rinc (2.0 -> 1.5)**: Decreasing the restart increment factor can lead to more frequent restarts, which can help escape local minima and potentially speed up convergence.
3. **var-decay (0.95 -> 0.9)**: A slightly lower variable decay rate can help in more dynamic variable selection, potentially leading to faster solving times.
4. **cla-decay (0.999 -> 0.99)**: A slightly higher clause decay rate can help in maintaining a more relevant set of clauses, improving the solver's efficiency.
5. **rnd-freq (0.0 -> 0.02)**: Introducing a small random frequency can help in breaking ties and exploring different parts of the search space, which can sometimes lead to faster solutions.
6. **rfirst (100 -> 50)**: Lowering the initial restart interval can help the solver converge more quickly by allowing it to explore different paths earlier.
7. **simp-gc-frac (0.5 -> 0.4)**: Reducing the simplification garbage collection fraction can reduce the overhead of this process, potentially speeding up the solver.
8. **sub-lim (1000 -> 500)**: Lowering the subsumption limit can reduce the computational effort spent on subsumption checks, which can be beneficial if the solver is spending too much time on this step.
9. **cl-lim (20 -> 10)**: Reducing the clause limit can help in keeping the problem size manageable, potentially leading to faster solving times.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-off between thoroughness and efficiency, optimizing the solver's performance for faster runtime.
