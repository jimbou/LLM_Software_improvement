### Explanation of Changes and Impact on Runtime Performance:

1. **`gc-frac := 0.3`**: Increasing this value slightly can help manage memory more effectively by reducing the frequency of garbage collection, which can be costly in terms of performance.

2. **`rinc := 2.1`**: Slightly increasing the restart increment can help the solver escape local optima more effectively, potentially leading to faster convergence to a solution.

3. **`var-decay := 0.97`**: A higher variable decay rate can help the solver focus more on recent clauses, which can improve performance in dynamic environments.

4. **`cla-decay := 0.998`**: Adjusting the clause decay rate can help maintain a balance between learning from past clauses and adapting to new information, which can improve overall performance.

5. **`rnd-freq := 0.02`**: Introducing a small amount of randomness can help the solver explore the search space more thoroughly, potentially finding better solutions faster.

6. **`rfirst := 120`**: Increasing the initial restart limit can allow the solver to explore more of the search space before restarting, which can lead to better performance in complex problems.

7. **`simp-gc-frac := 0.6`**: Increasing the simplification garbage collection fraction can help maintain a cleaner and more efficient search space, reducing the overhead of managing unnecessary data.

8. **`sub-lim := 1200`**: Raising the subsumption limit can help the solver perform more thorough subsumption checks, which can reduce the number of redundant clauses and improve performance.

9. **`cl-lim := 25`**: Increasing the clause limit can allow the solver to learn more complex and useful clauses, which can improve its ability to find solutions quickly.

These adjustments are designed to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and computational efficiency, which should collectively improve the runtime performance of the solver.
