### Explanation:
1. **luby**: Switched from `True` to `False`. This disables the Luby restart strategy, which can sometimes lead to more consistent performance depending on the problem instance.
2. **gc-frac**: Reduced from `0.2` to `0.1`. This reduces the frequency of garbage collection, potentially improving performance by reducing overhead.
3. **rinc**: Reduced from `2.0` to `1.5`. A lower increment factor can help the solver converge more smoothly and reduce the number of unnecessary restarts.
4. **var-decay**: Reduced from `0.95` to `0.9`. A lower decay factor can help in faster learning and adapting to changes in the problem structure.
5. **cla-decay**: Increased from `0.999` to `0.995`. A slightly higher decay factor can help in maintaining a balance between old and new clauses, potentially improving performance.
6. **rfirst**: Reduced from `100` to `50`. A lower initial conflict bound can help the solver start solving the problem more quickly, especially for problems that do not require deep exploration early on.

These changes aim to optimize the performance while maintaining the functionality of the system.
