### Explanation:
- **gc-frac**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to decrease the frequency of garbage collection, which can help reduce overhead.
- **cla-decay**: Adjusted from 0.999 to 0.995 to slightly increase the decay rate of clause activities, potentially improving the solver's ability to focus on more relevant clauses.
- All other parameters were kept the same as they are already set to optimal or near-optimal values based on the provided documentation and constraints.
