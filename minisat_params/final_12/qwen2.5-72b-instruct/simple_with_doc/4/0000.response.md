The provided parameters already seem to be well-tuned for performance based on the given documentation. However, if you are looking for specific improvements, here are some potential adjustments:

1. **Increase `rfirst`**: Starting with a higher initial conflict bound might help in reducing the number of early restarts, which can be costly.
2. **Adjust `rinc`**: Increasing the factor by which the conflict bound increases can help in reducing the frequency of restarts, potentially leading to better performance.
3. **Tune `cla-decay` and `var-decay`**: Slightly adjusting these decay factors can help in balancing the focus on recent conflicts versus historical data.

Here is an optimized configuration based on these suggestions:

```plaintext
luby := 'True'
rnd-init := 'False'
gc-frac := 0.2
rinc := 2.5
var-decay := 0.97
cla-decay := 0.995
rnd-freq := 0.0
rnd-seed := 91648253
phase-saving := 2
ccmin-mode := 2
rfirst := 200
pre := 'True'
verb := '1'
rcheck := 'False'
asymm := 'False'
elim := 'True'
simp-gc-frac := 0.5
sub-lim := 1000
cl-lim := 20
grow := 0
```

These changes aim to balance the trade-offs between early and late restarts, and between focusing on recent and historical data, which can lead to improved runtime performance.
