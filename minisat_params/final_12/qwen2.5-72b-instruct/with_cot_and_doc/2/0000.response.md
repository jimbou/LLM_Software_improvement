### Explanation of Changes:
1. **luby := 'False'**: Switching from Luby restarts to a different strategy (defaulting to Glucose21Restarts) can help stabilize the search process and potentially reduce the number of unnecessary restarts, leading to more efficient solving.
2. **gc-frac := 0.5**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively, reducing the overhead of memory management during the solving process.
3. **rinc := 1.5**: Lowering the conflict bound increase factor can make the solver more aggressive in exploring the search space, potentially finding solutions faster.
4. **var-decay := 0.9**: Reducing the variable activity decay factor can help the solver focus more on recently active variables, which might be more relevant to the current search context.
5. **cla-decay := 0.95**: Slightly increasing the clause activity decay factor can help the solver maintain a better balance between old and new clauses, improving the overall efficiency of the search.
6. **rnd-freq := 0.05**: Introducing a small randomization frequency can help the solver escape local minima and explore the search space more thoroughly.
7. **rfirst := 500**: Increasing the initial conflict bound can provide more time for the solver to explore before the first restart, potentially leading to better solution quality.
8. **sub-lim := 5000**: Increasing the sub-sum limit can allow the solver to handle larger instances more effectively, especially in complex problems.
9. **cl-lim := 50**: Increasing the clause limit can help the solver retain more useful clauses, which can be beneficial for solving more complex problems.

These changes aim to balance exploration and exploitation, manage memory more efficiently, and adapt the solver's behavior to better handle the given problem instance.
