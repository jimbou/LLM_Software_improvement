### Explanation of Changes:
1. **gc-frac**: Increased from 0.2 to 0.3. This change allows more aggressive garbage collection, which can reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance, especially on large problem instances.

2. **var-decay**: Decreased from 0.95 to 0.9. A lower decay factor for variable activities means that the algorithm will more quickly adapt to changes in the search space, potentially leading to faster convergence.

3. **cla-decay**: Increased from 0.999 to 0.995. A slightly higher decay factor for clause activities can help in reducing the impact of older clauses, which might be less relevant as the search progresses, thus improving the focus on more recent and potentially more relevant information.

These changes aim to balance memory management, adaptability, and the relevance of learned information, which can collectively contribute to better runtime performance.
