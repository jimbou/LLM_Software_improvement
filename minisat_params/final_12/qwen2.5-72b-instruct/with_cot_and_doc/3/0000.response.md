### Explanation of Changes:
1. **luby := 'False'**:
   - Disabling the Luby restart strategy can help in reducing the overhead associated with calculating the restart intervals. This might lead to more frequent restarts, which can help in escaping local minima faster.

2. **var-decay := 0.97**:
   - Increasing the variable activity decay factor from 0.95 to 0.97 will slow down the decay of variable activities. This can help in maintaining a more stable focus on important variables, potentially leading to better search efficiency.

3. **cla-decay := 0.995**:
   - Reducing the clause activity decay factor from 0.999 to 0.995 will slightly speed up the decay of clause activities. This can help in managing the memory footprint more efficiently, as less significant clauses will be removed more quickly.

4. **rfirst := 150**:
   - Increasing the initial conflict bound from 100 to 150 can provide a more robust starting point for the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process. This might help in avoiding premature restarts and allow the solver to explore deeper parts of the search space.

### Impact on Runtime Performance:
- **Restart Strategy**: By disabling the Luby restart strategy, we reduce the complexity of the restart mechanism, which can lead to a more straightforward and potentially faster search process.
- **Variable Activity Decay**: A slower decay rate for variable activities helps in maintaining a more focused search, which can improve the solver's ability to find solutions more efficiently.
- **Clause Activity Decay**: A slightly faster decay rate for clause activities helps in managing memory usage and ensuring that the solver does not get bogged down by too many old clauses.
- **Initial Conflict Bound**: A higher initial conflict bound allows the solver to explore more of the search space before restarting, which can lead to better overall performance.

These changes aim to balance the exploration and exploitation phases of the solver, leading to improved runtime performance.
