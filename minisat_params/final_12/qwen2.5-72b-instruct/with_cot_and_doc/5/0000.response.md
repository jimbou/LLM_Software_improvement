### Explanation:
1. **gc-frac (Garbage Collection Fraction)**: Increased from 0.2 to 0.3. This parameter controls the fraction of the total memory that triggers garbage collection. Increasing it slightly can help reduce the frequency of garbage collection, potentially improving runtime performance by reducing overhead.

2. **var-decay (Variable Decay Factor)**: Increased from 0.95 to 0.97. This parameter controls how quickly the activity of variables decays over time. A higher value means variables retain their activity longer, which can help maintain a more stable search direction and potentially reduce the number of conflicts.

3. **cla-decay (Clause Decay Factor)**: Increased from 0.999 to 0.995. This parameter controls how quickly the activity of clauses decays over time. A slightly lower decay factor can help keep more recent clauses relevant, which can improve the solver's ability to focus on recent problem structures.

4. **rfirst (Initial Conflict Bound)**: Increased from 100 to 150. This parameter sets the initial conflict bound for restarts. A higher initial conflict bound can allow the solver to explore more of the search space before restarting, potentially leading to better solutions.

### Impact on Runtime Performance:
- **gc-frac**: Reducing the frequency of garbage collection can improve performance by minimizing interruptions to the solving process.
- **var-decay**: A higher decay factor can help maintain a more consistent and stable search direction, reducing the likelihood of getting stuck in suboptimal regions of the search space.
- **cla-decay**: Keeping clauses more relevant can help the solver make better decisions, especially in complex problem instances.
- **rfirst**: A higher initial conflict bound allows the solver to explore more of the search space before restarting, which can lead to better solutions and potentially faster convergence.

These adjustments aim to balance exploration and exploitation, reduce unnecessary overhead, and maintain a more stable and effective search process.
