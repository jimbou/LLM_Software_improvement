### Explanation of Changes:
1. **gc-frac**:
   - **Original**: 0.2
   - **New**: 0.3
   - **Impact**: Increasing the garbage collection fraction can help manage memory more effectively, potentially reducing the overhead of garbage collection during the solving process.

2. **rinc**:
   - **Original**: 2.0
   - **New**: 2.5
   - **Impact**: Increasing the conflict bound increase factor can help the solver adapt more quickly to difficult instances, potentially leading to faster convergence.

3. **var-decay**:
   - **Original**: 0.95
   - **New**: 0.9
   - **Impact**: Decreasing the variable activity decay factor can make the solver more sensitive to recent activities, which can help in focusing on more relevant variables and potentially speed up the solving process.

4. **cla-decay**:
   - **Original**: 0.999
   - **New**: 0.995
   - **Impact**: Slightly decreasing the clause activity decay factor can help maintain a better balance between recent and older clauses, potentially improving the solver's ability to learn from past conflicts.

5. **rnd-freq**:
   - **Original**: 0.0
   - **New**: 0.05
   - **Impact**: Introducing a small amount of randomness in the decision-making process can help the solver escape local minima and explore different parts of the search space, potentially leading to better performance.

6. **rfirst**:
   - **Original**: 100
   - **New**: 150
   - **Impact**: Increasing the initial conflict bound can give the solver more time to explore the search space before the first restart, which can be beneficial for more complex problems.

7. **sub-lim**:
   - **Original**: 1000
   - **New**: 1200
   - **Impact**: Increasing the subproblem limit can allow the solver to handle larger subproblems, which can be useful for problems with many variables and clauses.

8. **cl-lim**:
   - **Original**: 20
   - **New**: 25
   - **Impact**: Increasing the clause limit can help the solver retain more clauses, which can improve its ability to learn and make better decisions, especially in complex scenarios.

These adjustments aim to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, memory management, and learning efficiency, all of which can contribute to improved runtime performance.
