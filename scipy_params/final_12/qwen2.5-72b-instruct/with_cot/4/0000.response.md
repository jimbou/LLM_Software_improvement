### Explanation:
1. **Method**: Changed from 'CG' to 'BFGS'. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is generally more robust and can converge faster than the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, especially for non-linear optimization problems. This should reduce the number of iterations needed to reach the solution, thereby improving runtime performance.

2. **Jacobian Approximation**: Changed from '2-point' to '3-point'. A 3-point approximation provides a more accurate estimate of the Jacobian, which can lead to better convergence properties and potentially fewer iterations. However, it does come with a slight increase in computational cost per iteration, but the overall performance gain is expected to outweigh this cost.

3. **Tolerance**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001`. While a tighter tolerance (`0.0001`) can result in a more precise solution, it often requires more iterations to achieve. By relaxing the tolerance slightly, the algorithm can converge faster, which is beneficial for runtime performance. This adjustment is suitable if the application can tolerate a small reduction in precision.

4. **Maximum Iterations**: Increased from `100` to `200`. Increasing the maximum number of iterations allows the algorithm more flexibility to converge, especially with the new method and Jacobian approximation. This ensures that the optimization process has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely stopping, which can improve the quality of the solution and, indirectly, runtime performance by avoiding suboptimal results.

These changes collectively aim to balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, resulting in a configuration that is likely to perform better in terms of runtime.
