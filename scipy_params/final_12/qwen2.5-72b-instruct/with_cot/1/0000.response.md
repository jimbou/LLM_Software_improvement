### Explanation:
1. **Method Change to BFGS**: The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is effective for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest converging method for all cases. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method often provides faster convergence and better performance, especially for non-linear optimization problems.

2. **Jacobian Estimation to 3-point**: Changing the Jacobian estimation from a 2-point to a 3-point method can provide more accurate derivative estimates, which can lead to more efficient convergence. This is particularly useful when the function being optimized has complex curvature.

3. **Tolerance Increase to 0.001**: Reducing the tolerance from 0.0001 to 0.001 can significantly speed up the convergence process. While this might result in a slightly less precise solution, it can greatly reduce the number of iterations required, thus improving runtime performance.

4. **Increase Maximum Iterations to 200**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from 100 to 200 allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge, especially with the potentially more accurate Jacobian and faster convergence method. This ensures that the algorithm has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely stopping.

These changes collectively aim to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, leading to improved runtime performance.
