### Explanation:
1. **Method**: The Conjugate Gradient method (`'CG'`) is already a good choice for large-scale problems and is kept unchanged as it generally provides a good balance between accuracy and performance.

2. **Jac (Jacobian Approximation)**: Changed from `'2-point'` to `'3-point'`. The `'3-point'` approximation can provide a more accurate estimate of the Jacobian, which can lead to faster convergence and better stability, especially for complex or non-linear problems.

3. **Tol (Tolerance)**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001`. A higher tolerance can reduce the computational effort required to reach a solution, potentially speeding up the runtime. However, this comes at the cost of potentially less precise results, but in many practical applications, a slightly higher tolerance is acceptable.

4. **Disp (Display Output)**: Kept as `'False'` to avoid additional overhead from displaying output during the iteration process, which can slow down the runtime.

5. **Maxiter (Maximum Iterations)**: Increased from `100` to `200`. Allowing more iterations can help ensure that the algorithm has enough iterations to converge, especially if the problem is complex or the initial guess is far from the solution. This can prevent premature termination and improve the overall performance and reliability of the solution.

These adjustments aim to balance accuracy and performance, ensuring that the solver converges efficiently while maintaining the necessary precision for the problem at hand.
