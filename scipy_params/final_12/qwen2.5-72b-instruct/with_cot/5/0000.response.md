```

### Explanation:
1. **Method**: The 'CG' (Conjugate Gradient) method is kept as it is generally efficient for large-scale problems and does not require significant adjustments.

2. **Jac (Jacobian)**: Changed from '2-point' to '3-point'. The '3-point' method provides a more accurate approximation of the Jacobian, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially in complex or non-linear problems.

3. **Tol (Tolerance)**: Increased from 0.0001 to 0.001. A slightly higher tolerance can reduce the computational time by allowing the solver to stop earlier when the solution is sufficiently close to the optimal. This is a trade-off between accuracy and speed, but often a small increase in tolerance does not significantly affect the final result while noticeably reducing runtime.

4. **Disp (Display)**: Kept as 'False'. Displaying information at each iteration can slow down the process, so keeping this as 'False' helps maintain optimal performance.

5. **Maxiter (Maximum Iterations)**: Increased from 100 to 200. Allowing more iterations can help the solver converge to a more accurate solution, especially if the problem is complex. This adjustment ensures that the solver has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely stopping.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
