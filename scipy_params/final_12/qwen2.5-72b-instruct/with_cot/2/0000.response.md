### Explanation:
1. **Method Change**: The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is effective for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest for smaller or less complex problems. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method, on the other hand, is a quasi-Newton method that generally converges faster and is more robust, especially when the problem has a non-linear structure.

2. **Jacobian Approximation**: Changing from '2-point' to '3-point' for the Jacobian approximation can provide a more accurate gradient estimate, which can lead to better convergence properties and potentially reduce the number of iterations needed to reach the solution.

3. **Max Iterations**: Increasing `maxiter` from 100 to 200 allows the optimization algorithm more iterations to converge, which is particularly useful for more complex problems where the solution space is larger or more intricate. This can help avoid premature termination and ensure that the algorithm has enough opportunities to find the optimal solution.

4. **Tolerance and Display**: The tolerance (`tol`) and display (`disp`) settings remain unchanged as they are already set to reasonable values that do not significantly impact performance.

These changes should collectively enhance the performance by improving convergence speed and robustness.
