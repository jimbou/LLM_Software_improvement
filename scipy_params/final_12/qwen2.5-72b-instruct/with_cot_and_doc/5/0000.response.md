### Explanation:

1. **Method Adjustment**:
   - **From**: `CG` 
   - **To**: `BFGS`
   - **Reason**: The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is generally more robust and can converge faster for many types of problems compared to the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix, which can lead to better performance, especially for problems where the gradient information is useful.

2. **Tolerance Adjustment**:
   - **From**: `0.0001`
   - **To**: `0.001`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the computational effort required to achieve convergence. This is particularly beneficial if the problem does not require extremely high precision, as it can significantly speed up the optimization process.

3. **Maximum Iterations Adjustment**:
   - **From**: `100`
   - **To**: `500`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations allows the optimizer more flexibility to find a better solution, especially for complex or non-linear problems. This can help ensure that the optimization process has enough iterations to converge to a satisfactory solution without prematurely terminating.

These adjustments aim to balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the solution, potentially leading to faster and more reliable convergence.
