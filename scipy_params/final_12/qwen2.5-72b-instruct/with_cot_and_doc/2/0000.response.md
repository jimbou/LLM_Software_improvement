### Explanation of Changes:
1. **method**: Changed from `CG` to `BFGS`.
   - **Impact**: The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is generally more robust and efficient than the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method for many problems. It uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to improve convergence, which can lead to faster and more reliable solutions.

2. **jac**: Changed from `2-point` to `3-point`.
   - **Impact**: A 3-point finite difference method provides a more accurate estimate of the gradient compared to a 2-point method. This can help the optimizer converge more quickly and accurately, especially for functions where the gradient is not well approximated by a 2-point method.

3. **maxiter**: Increased from `100` to `500`.
   - **Impact**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations allows the optimizer more opportunities to find a better solution. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex or non-linear problems where convergence might take longer. However, it's important to balance this with computational resources and time constraints.

4. **tol**: Retained at `0.0001`.
   - **Impact**: The tolerance level remains unchanged as it already provides a reasonable threshold for convergence. Adjusting this value would depend on the specific requirements of the problem, but for general use, the current value is appropriate.

5. **disp**: Retained at `False`.
   - **Impact**: Keeping the display of convergence messages turned off ensures that the output remains clean and focused. This is typically preferred unless you need detailed information about the optimization process for debugging or analysis.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance and robustness of the optimization process.
