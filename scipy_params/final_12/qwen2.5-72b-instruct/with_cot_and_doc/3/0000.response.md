```

### Explanation:
1. **method**: Changed from `CG` to `L-BFGS-B`.
   - **Impact**: The L-BFGS-B method is generally faster and more robust for a wide range of problems compared to CG. It also supports bounds on variables, which might be useful if such constraints are needed in the future.

2. **jac**: Changed from `2-point` to `3-point`.
   - **Impact**: The 3-point method provides a more accurate estimate of the gradient, which can lead to better convergence and potentially fewer iterations, although it may slightly increase the computational cost per iteration.

3. **tol**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001`.
   - **Impact**: A higher tolerance value means the optimization process will terminate earlier, which can reduce runtime at the cost of potentially less precise solutions. This trade-off is often acceptable if the solution is still sufficiently accurate for the application.

4. **maxiter**: Increased from `100` to `500`.
   - **Impact**: Allowing more iterations can help the optimizer find a better solution, especially for complex problems where the solution space is large. However, it also increases the maximum possible runtime. Setting it to 500 provides a balance between performance and thoroughness.

These changes should collectively improve the runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy and robustness.
