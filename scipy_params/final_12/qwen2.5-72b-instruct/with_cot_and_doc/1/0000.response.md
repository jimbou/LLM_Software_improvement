method := 'L-BFGS-B'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.00001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation:
1. **method**: Changed from `'CG'` to `'L-BFGS-B'`. The L-BFGS-B method is generally faster and more robust for large-scale problems, which can significantly improve runtime performance compared to the Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method.

2. **jac**: Changed from `'2-point'` to `'3-point'`. The `3-point` method for computing the Jacobian can provide a more accurate gradient estimate, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially for functions with complex gradients.

3. **tol**: Decreased from `0.0001` to `0.00001`. A tighter tolerance (`0.00001`) ensures that the optimization process continues until a more precise solution is found, which can be beneficial for achieving higher accuracy in the final result. However, it's important to balance this with computational efficiency, so the decrease is moderate.

4. **disp**: Kept as `'False'`. This setting prevents unnecessary output during the optimization process, which can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

5. **maxiter**: Increased from `100` to `500`. Increasing the maximum number of iterations allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge to a solution, especially with the more stringent tolerance. This can prevent premature termination and potentially improve the quality of the solution.

These changes should collectively enhance the runtime performance and robustness of the optimization process.
