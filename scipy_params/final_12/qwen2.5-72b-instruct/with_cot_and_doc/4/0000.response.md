### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Method Change to `L-BFGS-B`**:
   - The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method, while effective, can sometimes be slower in convergence compared to other methods like `L-BFGS-B`. `L-BFGS-B` is generally faster and more robust, especially for large-scale problems where it can handle bounds on variables efficiently. This change should lead to a faster convergence rate.

2. **Jacobian Method Change to `3-point`**:
   - The `3-point` method for computing the Jacobian provides a more accurate gradient estimation compared to the `2-point` method, which can help the optimizer converge more quickly and accurately. This improvement in gradient accuracy can reduce the number of iterations needed to reach the optimal solution.

3. **Tolerance Increase to `0.001`**:
   - Reducing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly speed up the optimization process. While a higher tolerance might result in a slightly less precise solution, it often leads to a substantial reduction in computation time, which is beneficial for many practical applications where extremely high precision is not critical.

4. **Maximum Iterations Increase to `500`**:
   - Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `500` allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge to a better solution, especially if the problem is complex. This change ensures that the optimization process has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely stopping due to the iteration limit.

These adjustments aim to balance between achieving a good solution and reducing computational time, making the optimization process more efficient.
