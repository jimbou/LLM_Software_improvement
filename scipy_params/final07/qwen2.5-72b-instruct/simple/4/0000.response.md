To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency while maintaining the solution's accuracy, we can make a few adjustments based on the typical behavior of optimization algorithms and the specific method used (Conjugate Gradient, or 'CG').

### Original Parameters:
- **method**: 'CG'
- **jac**: '2-point'
- **tol**: 0.0001
- **disp**: 'False'
- **maxiter**: 100

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **method**: 'CG' (unchanged)
   - The Conjugate Gradient method is already efficient for large-scale problems, so no change is needed here.

2. **jac**: '3-point' (changed from '2-point')
   - Using a '3-point' finite difference approximation for the Jacobian can provide a more accurate gradient estimate, which might lead to faster convergence and fewer iterations. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational time per iteration. If the function evaluations are expensive, you might want to stick with '2-point'. For most cases, the improved accuracy of '3-point' can outweigh the additional computation time.

3. **tol**: 0.001 (increased from 0.0001)
   - Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the number of iterations required to reach a solution. This is a trade-off between accuracy and speed. A tolerance of 0.001 is often sufficient for many practical applications.

4. **disp**: 'False' (unchanged)
   - Keeping `disp` as 'False' ensures that the algorithm does not print convergence messages, which can save some overhead in I/O operations.

5. **maxiter**: 150 (increased from 100)
   - Increasing the maximum number of iterations can allow the algorithm more flexibility to converge, especially if the problem is complex. However, setting it too high can lead to unnecessary computations if the algorithm converges quickly.

### Final Optimized Parameters:
- **method**: 'CG'
- **jac**: '3-point'
- **tol**: 0.001
- **disp**: 'False'
- **maxiter**: 150

### Explanation:
- **Method**: No change, as 'CG' is generally efficient.
- **Jacobian**: Changed to '3-point' for better gradient estimation.
- **Tolerance**: Increased to 0.001 to reduce the number of iterations.
- **Display**: Kept as 'False' to minimize I/O overhead.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased to 150 to allow more flexibility for convergence.

These changes should help improve the runtime efficiency while still providing a good solution. However, the actual performance will depend on the specific problem being solved, so it's always a good idea to test and adjust these parameters further if necessary.
