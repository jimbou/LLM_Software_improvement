To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency in an optimization algorithm like the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, we need to consider the trade-offs between accuracy, convergence speed, and computational cost. Hereâ€™s a refined set of parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **method**: `'CG'`  
  - The Conjugate Gradient method is already a good choice for large-scale problems due to its low memory requirements and fast convergence properties. No change needed here.
  
- **jac**: `'3-point'`  
  - While the `2-point` finite difference approximation is faster, using a `3-point` stencil can provide a more accurate Jacobian, which can lead to faster convergence and fewer iterations overall. This might slightly increase the per-iteration cost but can reduce the total number of iterations required, leading to better overall runtime performance.
  
- **tol**: `0.001`  
  - Increasing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly reduce the number of iterations required to reach a solution. This is a trade-off between precision and speed. If your application can tolerate a slightly less precise solution, this can greatly improve runtime performance.
  
- **disp**: `False`  
  - Keeping `disp` as `False` is optimal for runtime performance because displaying information at each iteration adds overhead.
  
- **maxiter**: `50`  
  - Reducing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `50` can prevent the algorithm from running unnecessarily long if it's not converging quickly. However, ensure that this value is still high enough to allow the algorithm to converge to a satisfactory solution.

### Summary:
- **method**: `'CG'`
- **jac**: `'3-point'`
- **tol**: `0.001`
- **disp**: `False`
- **maxiter**: `50`

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. Always test these parameters on your specific problem to ensure they meet your performance and accuracy requirements.
