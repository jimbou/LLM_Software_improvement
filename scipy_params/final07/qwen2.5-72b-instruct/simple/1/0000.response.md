To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency in an optimization algorithm (like the Conjugate Gradient method), we need to consider the trade-offs between accuracy, convergence speed, and computational cost. Here's a detailed look at each parameter and potential adjustments:

### Original Parameters:
- **method**: 'CG' (Conjugate Gradient method)
- **jac**: '2-point' (finite difference approximation of the Jacobian)
- **tol**: 0.0001 (tolerance for termination)
- **disp**: 'False' (do not display convergence messages)
- **maxiter**: 100 (maximum number of iterations)

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **method**: 'CG'
   - **Optimization**: The Conjugate Gradient method is generally efficient for large-scale problems, so no change is needed here.

2. **jac**: '2-point'
   - **Optimization**: Finite difference approximations can be computationally expensive. If the Jacobian can be computed analytically, this would significantly reduce the runtime. If an analytical Jacobian is not feasible, consider using a more efficient finite difference method like '3-point' or 'cs' (complex step) if supported.
   - **Suggested Change**: If possible, provide an analytical Jacobian. If not, consider changing to '3-point' for potentially better accuracy with a slight increase in computational cost.

3. **tol**: 0.0001
   - **Optimization**: A smaller tolerance leads to more accurate results but increases the number of iterations. Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the number of iterations and thus improve runtime.
   - **Suggested Change**: Increase the tolerance to 0.001 or 0.01, depending on the acceptable level of accuracy for your application.

4. **disp**: 'False'
   - **Optimization**: No change needed. Displaying convergence messages can slow down the process, so keeping it 'False' is optimal for runtime.

5. **maxiter**: 100
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the maximum number of iterations can speed up the process, but it might lead to premature termination without convergence. If the problem is well-behaved, you can try reducing this value.
   - **Suggested Change**: Try reducing `maxiter` to 50 or 75 and monitor the convergence. If the algorithm converges within these iterations, this will improve runtime.

### Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'CG'
jac := '3-point'  # or provide an analytical Jacobian if possible
tol := 0.001      # or 0.01, depending on the required accuracy
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 75     # or 50, depending on the problem behavior
```

### Summary:
- **Method**: No change (CG is efficient).
- **Jacobian**: Consider a more efficient finite difference method or provide an analytical Jacobian.
- **Tolerance**: Increase slightly to reduce the number of iterations.
- **Display**: Keep as 'False' to avoid overhead.
- **Max Iterations**: Reduce if the problem converges within fewer iterations.

These changes should help improve the runtime efficiency while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy.
