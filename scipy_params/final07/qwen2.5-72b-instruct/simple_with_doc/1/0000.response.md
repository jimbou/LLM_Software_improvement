To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the following aspects:

1. **Method Selection**: The choice of optimization algorithm (`method`) can significantly impact performance. The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method is generally efficient for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest for smaller or specific types of problems. We should consider whether another method might be more suitable.

2. **Jacobian Calculation**: The method of computing the Jacobian (`jac`) can also affect performance. The `2-point` method is straightforward but can be computationally expensive. If the function is smooth and differentiable, using a more accurate method like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step) might reduce the number of iterations needed to converge.

3. **Tolerance Setting**: The tolerance (`tol`) determines how precise the solution needs to be. A higher tolerance can lead to faster convergence but might result in a less accurate solution. Adjusting this value can help balance accuracy and speed.

4. **Display Control**: The `disp` parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed. Setting it to `False` can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

5. **Maximum Iterations**: The maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) should be set high enough to allow for convergence but not so high that it wastes computational resources.

Given these considerations, here is an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```python
method := 'BFGS'  # BFGS is generally faster and more robust than CG for many problems
jac := '3-point'  # More accurate Jacobian calculation, potentially reducing the number of iterations
tol := 0.001      # Slightly higher tolerance to speed up convergence
disp := 'False'   # No display of convergence messages to minimize I/O overhead
maxiter := 500    # Increase the maximum number of iterations to ensure convergence
```

### Explanation:
- **Method**: Switched to `BFGS` because it often converges faster and is more robust than `CG`, especially for non-linear problems.
- **Jacobian**: Changed to `3-point` for a more accurate gradient calculation, which can reduce the number of iterations needed to reach the solution.
- **Tolerance**: Increased to `0.001` to allow for faster convergence, which is a reasonable trade-off if a slightly less precise solution is acceptable.
- **Display**: Kept `disp` as `False` to avoid unnecessary I/O operations.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased to `500` to provide more flexibility for the optimizer to converge, especially with the more accurate Jacobian calculation.

This configuration should improve runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality and accuracy for most optimization tasks.
