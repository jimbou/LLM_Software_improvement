To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the following aspects:

1. **Method Selection**: The choice of optimization method can significantly affect performance. The `CG` method is generally efficient for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest for smaller problems. We can consider switching to a more efficient method if the problem size allows it.

2. **Jacobian Calculation**: The method of computing the Jacobian can also impact performance. The `2-point` method is simple but can be computationally expensive compared to more advanced methods like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step).

3. **Tolerance**: Reducing the tolerance (`tol`) can speed up the optimization process but at the cost of potentially less accurate solutions. If the current tolerance is overly stringent for the application, it can be relaxed.

4. **Maximum Iterations**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) can allow the optimizer to find a better solution but will increase runtime. However, if the current limit is too low, it might prevent the optimizer from converging.

5. **Display Messages**: Disabling display messages (`disp = False`) can reduce overhead, especially in high-performance computing environments where I/O operations can be costly.

Given these considerations, here is an optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```python
method := 'L-BFGS-B'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation:
1. **method := 'L-BFGS-B'**:
   - **Reason**: `L-BFGS-B` is often faster and more robust than `CG`, especially for problems with bounds. It is particularly effective for large-scale problems and can handle both unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization.

2. **jac := '3-point'**:
   - **Reason**: The `3-point` method for Jacobian calculation is more accurate than `2-point` and can lead to faster convergence. This is particularly useful if the function being optimized has a complex gradient.

3. **tol := 0.001**:
   - **Reason**: Relaxing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly reduce the number of iterations required to converge, thus improving runtime performance. This is a reasonable trade-off if the application can tolerate slightly less precise solutions.

4. **disp := 'False'**:
   - **Reason**: Keeping `disp` set to `False` ensures that no unnecessary output is generated, which can help reduce I/O overhead and improve performance.

5. **maxiter := 500**:
   - **Reason**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `500` allows the optimizer more flexibility to find a better solution, especially if the problem is complex. However, this should be balanced against the risk of increased runtime.

By making these adjustments, you should see improved runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality of the optimization process.
