To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the efficiency and compatibility of the parameters with the chosen optimization method. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to optimizing the parameters:

1. **Method Selection**:
   - The current method is `CG` (Conjugate Gradient). This method is generally efficient for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest in all cases. We can consider switching to a more robust method like `BFGS` or `L-BFGS-B` which often provide faster convergence and better performance.

2. **Jacobian Calculation**:
   - The current setting for `jac` is `2-point`. While this is a standard finite difference method, it can be computationally expensive. If the function is smooth and differentiable, using a more efficient method like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step) can reduce the computational cost of gradient estimation.

3. **Tolerance (`tol`)**:
   - The current tolerance is `0.0001`. This value is reasonable, but if the problem allows, increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the number of iterations needed to converge, thus improving performance. However, this should be done carefully to avoid losing accuracy.

4. **Display Messages (`disp`)**:
   - The current setting is `False`, which is fine as it prevents unnecessary output that could slow down the process. We can keep this as is.

5. **Maximum Iterations (`maxiter`)**:
   - The current setting is `100`. This might be too low for some complex problems, leading to premature termination. Increasing this value can allow the optimizer more iterations to find a better solution, but it should be balanced against the risk of excessive computation time.

### Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'BFGS'  # Switch to BFGS for potentially faster convergence
jac := '3-point'  # Use 3-point finite difference for more accurate gradient estimation
tol := 0.0005     # Slightly increase tolerance to reduce computation time, if acceptable
disp := False     # Keep display off to avoid unnecessary output
maxiter := 500    # Increase maximum iterations to allow more thorough optimization
```

### Explanation:
- **Method**: `BFGS` is chosen because it typically converges faster and is more robust than `CG`, especially for non-linear problems.
- **Jacobian**: `3-point` is selected to provide a more accurate gradient estimate, which can lead to better convergence properties.
- **Tolerance**: Increased to `0.0005` to reduce the number of iterations required, assuming the slight loss in precision is acceptable.
- **Display**: Kept as `False` to maintain clean output.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased to `500` to give the optimizer more flexibility to find a good solution, balancing between thoroughness and computational cost.

This optimized configuration should improve runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality for your optimization task.
