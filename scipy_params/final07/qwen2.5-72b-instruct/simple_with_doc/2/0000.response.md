To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between the different parameters. Here are some suggestions based on the provided documentation:

1. **method**: The current method is `CG`. While `CG` is a good general-purpose method, other methods like `BFGS` or `L-BFGS-B` might offer faster convergence for certain types of problems. `BFGS` is particularly effective for problems where the gradient can be computed efficiently.

2. **jac**: The current setting is `2-point`, which is a finite difference approximation. Using `3-point` can provide a more accurate gradient but at the cost of increased computation time. If the function is smooth and the gradient can be computed analytically, setting `jac` to `True` would be the most efficient.

3. **tol**: The current tolerance is `0.0001`. Reducing the tolerance can speed up the optimization process but may result in a less precise solution. Increasing the tolerance slightly (e.g., to `0.001`) can often lead to significant performance gains without a substantial loss in accuracy.

4. **disp**: The current setting is `False`, which is appropriate for production environments where you don't want to see convergence messages. This should remain `False` unless you need to debug or monitor the optimization process.

5. **maxiter**: The current maximum number of iterations is `100`. Increasing this value can allow the optimizer to run longer and potentially find a better solution, but it also increases the risk of longer runtimes. A reasonable compromise might be to increase it to `500` or `1000` depending on the problem complexity.

### Optimized Configuration:

```python
method := 'BFGS'  # More efficient for problems with computable gradients
jac := True       # Use analytical gradient if available
tol := 0.001      # Slightly relaxed tolerance for faster convergence
disp := False     # No display of convergence messages
maxiter := 500    # Allow more iterations for better solution quality
```

### Explanation:

- **method**: Switched to `BFGS` because it is generally faster and more robust for problems where the gradient can be computed.
- **jac**: Set to `True` to use the analytical gradient if available, which is more efficient than finite difference approximations.
- **tol**: Increased to `0.001` to allow for faster convergence, which is often sufficient for many practical applications.
- **disp**: Kept as `False` to avoid unnecessary output.
- **maxiter**: Increased to `500` to give the optimizer more room to find a better solution without significantly increasing the risk of excessive runtime.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the optimization process.
