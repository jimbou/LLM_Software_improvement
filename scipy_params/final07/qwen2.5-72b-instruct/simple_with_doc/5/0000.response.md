To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to consider the trade-offs between the choice of optimization method, the precision required, and the computational resources available. Here’s an optimized configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **method**: `BFGS`
   - **Reason**: The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method is generally more efficient and robust compared to Conjugate Gradient (CG). It often converges faster and requires fewer iterations, especially for problems where the Hessian matrix can be approximated well.

2. **jac**: `2-point`
   - **Reason**: Since `BFGS` supports the `jac` parameter, we keep it at `2-point`. This method is a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. If the function evaluations are expensive, you might consider switching to `3-point` for higher accuracy, but for most cases, `2-point` should suffice.

3. **tol**: `0.0001`
   - **Reason**: The tolerance level is already set to a reasonable value that balances precision and performance. Reducing it further would increase the computational cost without necessarily improving the solution quality significantly. However, if the problem is very sensitive, you might consider lowering it slightly, but for general purposes, `0.0001` is a good starting point.

4. **disp**: `False`
   - **Reason**: Keeping this as `False` ensures that no additional output is generated during the optimization process, which can save time and reduce clutter in the logs. Only set this to `True` if you need detailed convergence information for debugging purposes.

5. **maxiter**: `500`
   - **Reason**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from 100 to 500 allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge, especially for more complex or difficult problems. This can help avoid premature termination and improve the quality of the solution.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '2-point'
tol := 0.0001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation:

- **Method Change**: Switching from `CG` to `BFGS` can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially for non-linear problems.
- **Jac Setting**: `2-point` is retained as it provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Tolerance**: Kept at `0.0001` to maintain a reasonable balance between precision and performance.
- **Display**: Set to `False` to minimize overhead and log output.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased to `500` to allow the optimizer more iterations to find a better solution, which is particularly useful for complex problems.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while ensuring that the optimization process remains effective and reliable.
