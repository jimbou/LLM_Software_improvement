### Analysis and Optimization

To optimize the given configuration, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on runtime performance. These include the choice of optimization method (`method`), the method of computing the Jacobian (`jac`), the tolerance for termination (`tol`), and the maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`).

#### 1. **Method Selection**
The current method is `CG` (Conjugate Gradient). While `CG` is generally efficient for large-scale problems, it might not be the best choice if the problem has a specific structure or if a more robust method is needed. The `BFGS` (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) method is often a better choice because it approximates the Hessian matrix, which can lead to faster convergence and better handling of non-convex problems.

#### 2. **Jacobian Calculation**
The current Jacobian calculation method is `2-point`. This is a simple finite difference method, but it can be computationally expensive and less accurate compared to other methods like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step). The `3-point` method provides a more accurate approximation of the gradient, which can improve the convergence rate and reduce the number of iterations needed.

#### 3. **Tolerance for Termination**
The current tolerance (`tol`) is set to `0.0001`. This value is reasonable for many applications, but it can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the problem. If the problem allows for a slightly less precise solution, increasing the tolerance can reduce the computational time. However, if high precision is required, this value should remain low.

#### 4. **Maximum Number of Iterations**
The current maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) is set to `100`. This value might be too low for complex problems, leading to premature termination. Increasing `maxiter` can allow the optimizer more flexibility to converge to a better solution, especially if the problem is challenging.

### Optimized Configuration

Based on the analysis, here is the optimized configuration:

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Method: `BFGS`**
   - **Impact**: `BFGS` is generally more robust and can handle a wider range of problems, including non-convex ones. It also tends to converge faster due to its approximation of the Hessian matrix.
   - **Benefit**: Improved convergence rate and robustness.

2. **Jacobian: `3-point`**
   - **Impact**: A more accurate gradient approximation can lead to better convergence properties and fewer iterations.
   - **Benefit**: Reduced number of iterations and improved accuracy.

3. **Tolerance: `0.001`**
   - **Impact**: Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the computational time without significantly compromising the solution's quality.
   - **Benefit**: Faster convergence while maintaining acceptable precision.

4. **Maximum Number of Iterations: `500`**
   - **Impact**: Allowing more iterations can help the optimizer find a better solution, especially for complex problems.
   - **Benefit**: Better handling of difficult problems and reduced risk of premature termination.

By making these adjustments, the optimized configuration should provide a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, leading to improved runtime performance.
