To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance, we need to carefully analyze each parameter and its potential impact on the optimization process. Here’s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Step 1: Analyze the Parameters

1. **method**: The choice of optimization algorithm can significantly affect both the speed and the quality of the solution. The current method is `CG` (Conjugate Gradient), which is generally efficient for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest for all types of functions.

2. **jac**: The method for computing the Jacobian (gradient) can also impact performance. The current setting is `2-point`, which is a simple finite difference approximation. More accurate methods like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step) can provide better gradients but at the cost of increased computational time.

3. **tol**: This parameter controls the precision of the solution. A smaller tolerance can lead to more accurate results but requires more iterations, potentially increasing runtime.

4. **disp**: This parameter controls the display of convergence messages. Setting it to `True` can help in debugging but does not affect runtime performance directly.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Increasing this value can allow the optimizer to find a better solution but will increase the runtime if the solution is not found within fewer iterations.

### Step 2: Suggest Adjustments

1. **method**: Consider switching from `CG` to `BFGS` (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno). BFGS is often faster and more robust for a wide range of problems, especially when the gradient can be computed efficiently.

2. **jac**: Since `BFGS` supports the `jac` parameter, we can keep it as `2-point` for now. However, if the function is smooth and the gradient can be computed analytically, consider setting `jac` to `True` to provide the exact gradient, which can speed up convergence.

3. **tol**: A slightly larger tolerance might be acceptable if the application does not require extremely high precision. For example, increasing `tol` to `0.001` can reduce the number of iterations needed.

4. **disp**: Set `disp` to `False` to avoid unnecessary output, which can slightly improve performance.

5. **maxiter**: Increase `maxiter` to a higher value, such as `500`, to ensure that the optimizer has enough iterations to converge to a good solution. However, monitor the actual runtime to ensure it doesn't become excessively long.

### Step 3: Provide the Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '2-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **method**: Switching from `CG` to `BFGS` can improve the convergence rate and robustness of the optimization process. BFGS is known for its efficiency in many practical scenarios.

2. **jac**: Keeping `2-point` for now, but consider switching to `True` if an analytical gradient is available. This can further speed up the optimization by providing more accurate gradient information.

3. **tol**: Increasing `tol` to `0.001` reduces the precision requirement, which can decrease the number of iterations needed to reach a solution, thus improving runtime.

4. **disp**: Setting `disp` to `False` ensures that no additional output is generated, which can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

5. **maxiter**: Increasing `maxiter` to `500` allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge to a good solution, which is particularly useful if the problem is complex and requires more iterations.

By making these adjustments, the optimization process should run faster while still achieving a satisfactory solution.
