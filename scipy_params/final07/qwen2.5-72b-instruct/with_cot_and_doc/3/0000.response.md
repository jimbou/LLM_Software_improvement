### Analysis and Optimization of Parameters

#### Step 1: Analyzing the Parameters

1. **method**: The choice of optimization algorithm can significantly impact the runtime and efficiency of the optimization process. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the nature of the problem (e.g., smoothness of the function, presence of constraints).

2. **jac**: The method of computing the Jacobian can affect the accuracy and speed of the optimization. For some algorithms, providing an analytical Jacobian can be more efficient than numerical approximations.

3. **tol**: The tolerance for termination is crucial as it determines when the optimization process stops. A smaller tolerance can lead to more accurate solutions but at the cost of increased computational time.

4. **disp**: This parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed, which does not directly impact runtime but can be useful for debugging.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations allowed can limit the computational time but might also prevent the algorithm from finding the optimal solution if set too low.

#### Step 2: Suggested Adjustments

1. **method**: The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method is generally good for large-scale problems where the Hessian matrix is not available. However, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (`BFGS`) method often converges faster and is more robust, especially for non-linear problems. We should consider switching to `BFGS`.

2. **jac**: Using a more accurate Jacobian computation method can improve convergence. The `3-point` method provides better accuracy than the `2-point` method, which can lead to faster convergence. Alternatively, if an analytical Jacobian is available, it should be provided.

3. **tol**: A tolerance of `0.0001` is quite strict and might be unnecessarily high for many practical applications. Reducing the tolerance slightly can reduce the computational time without significantly affecting the quality of the solution.

4. **disp**: Setting this to `True` can help in monitoring the optimization process, but for production environments, it is usually set to `False` to avoid unnecessary output.

5. **maxiter**: The default value of `100` is relatively low and might not be sufficient for complex problems. Increasing this value can allow the algorithm more iterations to find a better solution, but it should be balanced against computational resources.

#### Step 3: Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **method**: Switching from `CG` to `BFGS` is expected to improve convergence speed and robustness, especially for non-linear problems. `BFGS` is known for its ability to approximate the Hessian matrix, which can lead to faster convergence.

2. **jac**: Changing from `2-point` to `3-point` increases the accuracy of the Jacobian approximation, which can help the optimizer converge more quickly and accurately. If an analytical Jacobian is available, it should be used instead.

3. **tol**: Reducing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` allows the optimization to terminate earlier, which can save computational time. This change is based on the assumption that a slightly less precise solution is acceptable for the application.

4. **disp**: Keeping this as `False` ensures that the output remains clean and avoids unnecessary logging during the optimization process.

5. **maxiter**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `500` gives the optimizer more flexibility to find a better solution, especially for complex problems. This change should be monitored to ensure it does not lead to excessively long runtimes.

These adjustments aim to balance the trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality, leading to improved runtime performance.
