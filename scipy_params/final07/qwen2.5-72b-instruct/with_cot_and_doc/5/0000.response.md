### Analysis and Optimization

#### Step 1: Analyze Parameters

1. **method**: The choice of optimization algorithm can significantly affect the runtime and convergence speed. The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method is generally efficient for large-scale problems but might not be the fastest for smaller problems or problems with specific characteristics.

2. **jac**: The method of computing the Jacobian can also impact performance. The `2-point` method is a simple finite difference approximation, which can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems. More sophisticated methods like `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step) can provide more accurate gradients at the cost of additional computation.

3. **tol**: A tighter tolerance (`tol`) can lead to more accurate solutions but may increase the number of iterations required to converge, thus increasing runtime.

4. **disp**: Setting `disp` to `True` can help in debugging but does not directly affect runtime performance.

5. **maxiter**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations can allow the optimizer to find a better solution but will also increase the runtime. Conversely, reducing it can speed up the process but might result in suboptimal solutions.

#### Step 2: Suggested Adjustments

1. **method**: Consider switching to `BFGS` or `L-BFGS-B`. Both are quasi-Newton methods that approximate the Hessian matrix, which can lead to faster convergence compared to `CG`, especially for problems where the Hessian is not easily computable.

2. **jac**: If the problem dimension is not too high, consider using the `3-point` method for a more accurate gradient estimation. For very high-dimensional problems, `cs` (Complex Step) might be more efficient despite its higher computational cost per iteration.

3. **tol**: Increase the tolerance slightly to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence. This can significantly speed up the process, especially if the current tolerance is overly strict for the problem at hand.

4. **disp**: Keep `disp` as `False` unless you need detailed convergence information for debugging.

5. **maxiter**: Increase the maximum number of iterations to `500` to ensure that the optimizer has enough iterations to converge, even with a looser tolerance.

#### Step 3: Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **method**: Switching to `BFGS` leverages a more advanced quasi-Newton method that can converge faster and handle a wider range of problems efficiently.

2. **jac**: Using the `3-point` method provides a more accurate gradient estimation, which can lead to better convergence properties, especially for problems where the gradient is critical.

3. **tol**: Increasing the tolerance to `0.001` reduces the strictness of the convergence criteria, potentially reducing the number of iterations needed and thus speeding up the optimization process.

4. **disp**: Keeping `disp` as `False` ensures that the output remains clean and does not add any overhead to the runtime.

5. **maxiter**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations to `500` gives the optimizer more flexibility to converge, especially with the looser tolerance.

These changes should result in a more efficient optimization process with a balance between accuracy and runtime performance.
