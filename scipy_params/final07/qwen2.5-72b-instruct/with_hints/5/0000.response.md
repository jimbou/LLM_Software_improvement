To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an analysis and suggested improvements:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **method**: The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is generally efficient for large-scale problems, but it might not be the fastest in all cases. However, changing this would depend on the specific problem being solved, so we'll keep it as is unless there's a clear alternative that performs better for your specific use case.

2. **jac**: The Jacobian approximation method (`'2-point'`) can affect the accuracy and speed of convergence. A more accurate Jacobian can sometimes lead to faster convergence, but it also increases the computational cost per iteration. If the problem is well-behaved, a less accurate but faster Jacobian approximation might be sufficient.

3. **tol**: The tolerance (`tol`) controls the stopping criterion. A higher tolerance can lead to faster convergence but might result in a less accurate solution. Adjusting this can significantly impact both runtime and accuracy.

4. **disp**: This parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed. Setting it to `True` can help with debugging but adds overhead. For production, it should be set to `False`.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) can limit the runtime but might prevent the algorithm from converging to a satisfactory solution if set too low.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **method**: `'CG'` (Keep as is, unless you have a specific reason to change it based on your problem).
- **jac**: `'3-point'` (This can provide a more accurate Jacobian, potentially leading to faster convergence, especially if the function is non-linear and complex).
- **tol**: `0.001` (Increase the tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence, trading off some precision for speed).
- **disp**: `False` (Keep as is to avoid unnecessary overhead).
- **maxiter**: `150` (Increase slightly to allow for more iterations if needed, but not excessively to avoid long runtimes).

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'CG'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 150
```

### Explanation:
- **jac**: Changing from `'2-point'` to `'3-point'` can improve the accuracy of the Jacobian, which might lead to fewer iterations and thus faster convergence.
- **tol**: Increasing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` reduces the strictness of the stopping criterion, allowing the algorithm to converge faster at the expense of a slight loss in precision.
- **maxiter**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `150` provides a bit more flexibility for the algorithm to converge, especially if the problem is complex.

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the overall functionality and accuracy of the system.
