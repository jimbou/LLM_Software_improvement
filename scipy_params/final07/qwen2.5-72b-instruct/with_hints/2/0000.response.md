To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, let's analyze each parameter and suggest improvements:

### Original Parameters:
- **method**: 'CG' (Conjugate Gradient method)
- **jac**: '2-point' (Finite difference approximation for the Jacobian)
- **tol**: 0.0001 (Tolerance for convergence)
- **disp**: 'False' (Display convergence messages)
- **maxiter**: 100 (Maximum number of iterations)

### Analysis and Suggestions:

1. **method**: The Conjugate Gradient method is generally efficient for large-scale problems, but it might not be the fastest for all types of problems. If the problem is small or has a specific structure, other methods like 'BFGS' (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) or 'L-BFGS-B' (Limited-memory BFGS with bounds) might converge faster.

2. **jac**: The '2-point' finite difference approximation can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. If an analytical Jacobian is available, using it can significantly speed up the optimization process. If not, consider using a more efficient finite difference method like '3-point' which can provide a better approximation with fewer function evaluations.

3. **tol**: The tolerance for convergence (`tol`) is set to `0.0001`. A higher tolerance can lead to faster convergence but at the cost of potentially less accurate results. If the application can tolerate some inaccuracy, increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the runtime.

4. **disp**: Setting `disp` to 'False' is good for reducing overhead, as it prevents the display of convergence messages. This should remain unchanged unless you need to monitor the convergence process.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) is set to 100. If the problem is known to converge quickly, reducing this value can save time. However, if the problem is complex and requires more iterations, increasing this value might be necessary to ensure convergence.

### Optimized Parameters:
- **method**: 'BFGS' (or 'L-BFGS-B' if bounds are needed)
- **jac**: '3-point' (if an analytical Jacobian is not available)
- **tol**: 0.001 (increased tolerance for faster convergence)
- **disp**: 'False' (no change)
- **maxiter**: 50 (reduced if the problem converges quickly, otherwise keep it at 100)

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 50
```

### Explanation:
- **method**: Changed to 'BFGS' for potentially faster convergence.
- **jac**: Changed to '3-point' for a more accurate finite difference approximation.
- **tol**: Increased to 0.001 to allow for faster convergence, assuming the application can tolerate a slight decrease in accuracy.
- **disp**: Kept as 'False' to maintain low overhead.
- **maxiter**: Reduced to 50 to save time, assuming the problem converges within this limit. If not, consider increasing it back to 100.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system.
