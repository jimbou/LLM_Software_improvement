To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and suggested improvements:

### Analysis:
1. **method**: The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is generally efficient for large sparse systems but can be slow for certain types of problems. It is a good choice for its balance between speed and memory usage, but it might not be the best for all cases.
2. **jac**: The Jacobian approximation method ('2-point' in this case) affects the accuracy and speed of the solution. A more accurate Jacobian can lead to faster convergence but at the cost of increased computation time.
3. **tol**: The tolerance for termination (`tol`) determines how precise the solution needs to be. A smaller tolerance means more iterations and longer runtime.
4. **disp**: Displaying output during the iteration process can add overhead but is useful for debugging.
5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations can limit the runtime but may also prevent the solver from finding a sufficiently accurate solution.

### Optimized Parameters:
1. **method**: Keep `CG` as it is generally efficient, but consider profiling the specific problem to see if another method like `BFGS` or `L-BFGS-B` might be faster.
2. **jac**: Use a more efficient Jacobian approximation if possible. For example, `'3-point'` can provide a better balance between accuracy and speed compared to `'2-point'`.
3. **tol**: Increase the tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations. For example, changing `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly reduce runtime without a large loss in precision.
4. **disp**: Set to `False` to avoid additional overhead from printing intermediate results.
5. **maxiter**: Increase the maximum number of iterations if the problem is not converging within the current limit, but monitor the actual number of iterations needed to ensure it doesn't become a bottleneck.

### Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'CG'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 200
```

### Explanation:
- **method**: Kept as `CG` but consider testing other methods if performance is still an issue.
- **jac**: Changed to `'3-point'` for potentially better convergence with a slight increase in computational cost.
- **tol**: Increased to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations required.
- **disp**: Set to `False` to minimize overhead.
- **maxiter**: Increased to `200` to allow for more iterations if needed, but monitor the actual number of iterations to avoid unnecessary computations.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system.
