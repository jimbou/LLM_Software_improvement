To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to consider the impact of each parameter on the performance of the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. Hereâ€™s an analysis and suggested improvements:

### Analysis of Parameters

1. **method**: The method is set to 'CG' (Conjugate Gradient), which is a good choice for solving large sparse systems of linear equations. Changing this would alter the algorithm used, so it should remain as 'CG'.

2. **jac**: This parameter specifies the Jacobian approximation method. For the CG method, the Jacobian is not typically required, but if it is being used in a broader context (e.g., within an optimization routine), '2-point' is a reasonable default. However, if the Jacobian is not necessary, it can be omitted or set to `None` to avoid unnecessary computations.

3. **tol**: The tolerance (`tol`) determines the stopping criterion for the solver. A smaller tolerance means more accurate results but longer computation time. Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce runtime without significantly affecting the solution quality.

4. **disp**: This parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed. Setting it to 'False' is appropriate for reducing overhead and keeping the output clean.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`) limits how long the solver will run. Increasing this value can improve the chances of finding a more accurate solution, but it also increases runtime. If the current value is too low, the solver might terminate prematurely without converging.

### Optimized Parameters

Based on the analysis, here are the optimized parameters:

```python
method := 'CG'
jac := None  # Omitting the Jacobian if not necessary
tol := 0.001  # Slightly increase the tolerance to reduce runtime
disp := 'False'  # Keep this as False to avoid additional overhead
maxiter := 200  # Increase the maximum iterations to ensure convergence
```

### Explanation

- **jac**: Set to `None` to avoid unnecessary Jacobian calculations, which can save computational resources.
- **tol**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001`. This slight increase in tolerance can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed to converge, thus reducing runtime.
- **maxiter**: Increased from `100` to `200`. This ensures that the solver has enough iterations to converge, even with the increased tolerance. If the problem is well-conditioned, this should not significantly increase runtime.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the accuracy and functionality of the system.
