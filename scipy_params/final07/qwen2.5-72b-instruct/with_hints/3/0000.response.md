To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here's an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis:
1. **Method (`method`)**: The Conjugate Gradient method (`'CG'`) is generally efficient for large-scale problems but can be sensitive to the choice of initial guess and tolerance. It is a good choice for many problems, but if the problem size is small, other methods like `'BFGS'` might be faster.

2. **Jacobian Approximation (`jac`)**: The `'2-point'` finite difference approximation is straightforward but can be computationally expensive. If the Jacobian can be computed analytically, it would significantly reduce the computational cost.

3. **Tolerance (`tol`)**: A smaller tolerance value (`0.0001`) ensures a more accurate solution but increases the number of iterations required to converge. Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the runtime without significantly affecting the solution quality.

4. **Display Information (`disp`)**: Setting `disp` to `'False'` is good for reducing overhead, as it prevents the solver from printing intermediate information.

5. **Maximum Iterations (`maxiter`)**: The maximum number of iterations (`100`) should be set to a reasonable value that balances between ensuring convergence and avoiding excessive computation time. If the problem is expected to converge quickly, reducing this value can help.

### Optimized Parameters:
```python
method := 'CG'
jac := '3-point'  # More accurate than '2-point', but more expensive. Consider using an analytical Jacobian if possible.
tol := 0.001      # Increase tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations.
disp := 'False'   # Keep this as False to avoid unnecessary output.
maxiter := 50     # Reduce the maximum number of iterations if the problem converges quickly.
```

### Explanation:
- **Jacobian Approximation**: Changed from `'2-point'` to `'3-point'` for potentially better accuracy. If an analytical Jacobian is available, use that instead to further improve performance.
- **Tolerance**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.
- **Maximum Iterations**: Reduced from `100` to `50` to limit the computational effort, assuming the problem converges within this range.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality and accuracy of the system. If the problem is particularly sensitive to the choice of method or requires high precision, further adjustments may be necessary.
