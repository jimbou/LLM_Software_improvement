### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, let's first understand what each parameter does:

1. **method**: The optimization method used. 'CG' stands for Conjugate Gradient, which is a good choice for large-scale problems but can be slow to converge.
2. **jac**: The method for computing the Jacobian. '2-point' finite differences are used here, which can be computationally expensive.
3. **tol**: The tolerance for termination. A smaller value means the solver will run longer to achieve a more precise solution.
4. **disp**: Whether to print convergence messages. Setting it to 'False' can reduce I/O overhead.
5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations allowed. A higher value allows more time for convergence but can increase runtime.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Method**: Consider switching from 'CG' to 'BFGS' (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno). BFGS is generally faster and more robust for a wide range of problems.
2. **Jacobian**: Use an analytical Jacobian if possible, as it is typically more efficient than numerical approximations like '2-point'. If an analytical Jacobian is not available, consider using '3-point' finite differences, which can provide a more accurate approximation at the cost of additional function evaluations.
3. **Tolerance**: Increase the tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence. For example, changing `tol` from `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly speed up the process while still maintaining reasonable accuracy.
4. **Display**: Keep `disp` set to 'False' to minimize I/O overhead.
5. **Max Iterations**: Reduce `maxiter` if the problem is expected to converge quickly. However, be cautious not to set it too low, as this can prevent convergence.

### Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'  # Use '3-point' if an analytical Jacobian is not available
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 80
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Method**: Switching from 'CG' to 'BFGS' can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially for non-linear problems.
2. **Jacobian**: Using '3-point' finite differences provides a more accurate approximation of the Jacobian, which can help the solver converge more efficiently.
3. **Tolerance**: Increasing `tol` from `0.0001` to `0.001` reduces the precision requirement, allowing the solver to terminate earlier and thus reducing runtime.
4. **Display**: Keeping `disp` set to 'False' minimizes the overhead associated with printing convergence messages.
5. **Max Iterations**: Reducing `maxiter` from `100` to `80` can speed up the process if the problem converges within fewer iterations. This change should be tested to ensure it does not prevent convergence.

By making these adjustments, the runtime performance should improve while maintaining acceptable accuracy and robustness.
