### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance, let's first analyze each parameter and understand its potential impact:

1. **method := 'CG'**:
   - The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is generally efficient for large sparse systems. However, it might not be the fastest method for all types of problems. Other methods like 'BFGS' or 'L-BFGS-B' can sometimes offer faster convergence for certain types of functions.

2. **jac := '2-point'**:
   - The Jacobian approximation method '2-point' uses finite differences to estimate the gradient. This can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. Using an exact Jacobian or a more efficient approximation method (like '3-point') could reduce the computational overhead.

3. **tol := 0.0001**:
   - The tolerance level determines the stopping criterion. A lower tolerance means the algorithm will run longer to achieve a more precise solution. Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the runtime, but at the cost of potentially less accurate results.

4. **disp := 'False'**:
   - Setting `disp` to 'True' will display convergence messages, which can be useful for debugging but adds minimal overhead. Keeping it 'False' is generally better for performance.

5. **maxiter := 100**:
   - The maximum number of iterations limits how long the algorithm can run. If the problem is complex, increasing this value might help the algorithm converge to a solution, but it also increases the risk of longer runtime. Balancing this value is crucial.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Change the method to 'BFGS'**:
   - The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method is a quasi-Newton method that often converges faster than CG, especially for non-linear problems.

2. **Use a more efficient Jacobian approximation**:
   - Change `jac` to '3-point' or use an exact Jacobian if possible. The '3-point' method provides a better approximation than '2-point' and can lead to faster convergence.

3. **Increase the tolerance slightly**:
   - Increase `tol` to 0.001. This will reduce the number of iterations required to meet the stopping criterion, potentially speeding up the runtime.

4. **Keep `disp` as 'False'**:
   - No change needed here as displaying messages is not necessary for performance optimization.

5. **Adjust `maxiter` based on the problem complexity**:
   - Increase `maxiter` to 200 to allow the algorithm more iterations to converge, especially with the new method and Jacobian settings.

### Optimized Parameters

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 200
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Method Change to 'BFGS'**:
   - BFGS is known for its efficiency in handling non-linear optimization problems. It typically requires fewer iterations to converge compared to CG, leading to a faster runtime.

2. **Jacobian Approximation Change to '3-point'**:
   - The '3-point' method provides a more accurate approximation of the Jacobian, which can help the algorithm converge faster and more reliably.

3. **Tolerance Increase to 0.001**:
   - By increasing the tolerance, the algorithm will stop earlier, reducing the number of iterations and thus the runtime. This trade-off is often acceptable if the slight loss in precision is not critical.

4. **Maxiter Increase to 200**:
   - Allowing more iterations can help ensure that the algorithm has enough time to converge, especially with the new method and Jacobian settings. This balance helps in achieving a good solution without excessive runtime.

By making these adjustments, the overall runtime performance should improve while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy.
