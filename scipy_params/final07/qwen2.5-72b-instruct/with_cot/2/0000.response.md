### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the runtime performance of the given configuration, we need to analyze each parameter and understand its impact on the performance:

1. **method := 'CG'**:
   - The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is efficient for large sparse systems but might not be the fastest for smaller or dense systems. It is generally good for problems where the Hessian matrix is positive definite.

2. **jac := '2-point'**:
   - The Jacobian approximation method '2-point' is a finite difference method. While it is simple, it can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. Other methods like '3-point' or using an analytical Jacobian might be more efficient.

3. **tol := 0.0001**:
   - The tolerance level determines the precision of the solution. A lower tolerance can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased computation time. Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the number of iterations needed.

4. **disp := 'False'**:
   - This parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed. Setting it to 'True' can help in debugging but will not significantly impact performance.

5. **maxiter := 100**:
   - The maximum number of iterations can limit the solver's ability to find a solution if set too low. However, setting it too high can lead to unnecessary computations if the solution is found earlier.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Method**: Consider switching to a more robust method if the problem size and nature allow it. For example, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method is often faster and more reliable for a wide range of problems.
2. **Jacobian Approximation**: If possible, use an analytical Jacobian instead of a finite difference approximation. If an analytical Jacobian is not feasible, consider using a more accurate finite difference method like '3-point'.
3. **Tolerance**: Increase the tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.
4. **Display**: Keep `disp` as 'False' unless you need detailed convergence information.
5. **Maximum Iterations**: Adjust `maxiter` based on the expected number of iterations needed for convergence. If the problem is known to converge quickly, reducing this value can save time.

### Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 200
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Method**: Switching from 'CG' to 'BFGS' can provide faster convergence and better performance for a wider range of problems. BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix, making it more efficient for many practical applications.
2. **Jacobian Approximation**: Using '3-point' instead of '2-point' can provide a more accurate Jacobian approximation, which can lead to fewer iterations and faster convergence.
3. **Tolerance**: Increasing the tolerance from 0.0001 to 0.001 reduces the precision requirement, which can significantly decrease the number of iterations needed to reach a solution.
4. **Display**: Keeping `disp` as 'False' ensures that no additional overhead is added for displaying convergence messages.
5. **Maximum Iterations**: Doubling `maxiter` to 200 provides more flexibility for the solver to converge, especially if the problem is complex or the initial guess is far from the solution.

By implementing these changes, the runtime performance should improve, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.
