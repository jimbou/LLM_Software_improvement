### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the runtime performance, we need to understand the impact of each parameter on the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, which is an iterative algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. Here's a brief analysis of each parameter:

1. **method**: The method is set to 'CG' (Conjugate Gradient). This is a good choice for large sparse systems, but we need to ensure other parameters are configured optimally to support this method.

2. **jac**: The Jacobian approximation method is set to '2-point'. This is a finite difference approximation, which can be computationally expensive. Depending on the problem, a more efficient Jacobian approximation might be available.

3. **tol**: The tolerance for convergence is set to `0.0001`. A smaller tolerance means the algorithm will run longer to achieve a more precise solution, which can increase runtime.

4. **disp**: This parameter controls whether convergence messages are displayed. Setting it to 'False' is fine for production environments where you don't need verbose output.

5. **maxiter**: The maximum number of iterations is set to 100. If the problem is complex, this might not be sufficient, leading to premature termination and potentially inaccurate solutions. However, if the problem is simple, a lower value might suffice.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **jac**: If the problem allows, consider using a more efficient Jacobian approximation method. For example, if the function is smooth and differentiable, an analytical Jacobian might be more efficient than a finite difference approximation.

2. **tol**: Increase the tolerance slightly to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence. For example, setting `tol` to `0.001` might still provide acceptable accuracy while reducing runtime.

3. **maxiter**: Increase the maximum number of iterations to ensure the algorithm has enough iterations to converge, especially for more complex problems. However, monitor the actual number of iterations needed to avoid unnecessary computation.

### Optimized Configuration

```python
method := 'CG'
jac := 'analytical'  # Use an analytical Jacobian if possible
tol := 0.001         # Increase tolerance to reduce iterations
disp := 'False'      # Keep display off for production
maxiter := 200       # Increase maximum iterations for complex problems
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **jac := 'analytical'**:
   - **Impact**: Using an analytical Jacobian can significantly reduce the computational cost compared to finite difference approximations. This change can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially for large-scale problems.

2. **tol := 0.001**:
   - **Impact**: By increasing the tolerance, the algorithm will require fewer iterations to meet the convergence criteria. This reduces the overall runtime, although it may result in a slightly less precise solution. For many practical applications, this trade-off is acceptable.

3. **maxiter := 200**:
   - **Impact**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations ensures that the algorithm has enough iterations to converge, even for more complex problems. This prevents premature termination and ensures that the solution is as accurate as possible within the given constraints.

By making these adjustments, the runtime performance should improve, and the algorithm should be more efficient while still providing a sufficiently accurate solution.
