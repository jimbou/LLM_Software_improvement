### Analysis of Parameters

1. **Method (`method`)**: The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is used for solving large systems of linear equations. It is generally efficient for large sparse matrices but might not be the best choice for all types of problems. The choice of method can significantly impact the convergence rate and overall runtime.

2. **Jacobian Approximation (`jac`)**: The '2-point' method is a finite difference approximation for the Jacobian matrix. This method can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. The accuracy of the Jacobian approximation can affect the convergence speed and stability of the solver.

3. **Tolerance (`tol`)**: The tolerance level (`0.0001`) determines the precision of the solution. A smaller tolerance can lead to more accurate results but at the cost of increased computational time. Conversely, a larger tolerance can reduce runtime but may result in less accurate solutions.

4. **Display Information (`disp`)**: Setting `disp` to 'False' prevents the solver from printing intermediate information, which can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations.

5. **Maximum Iterations (`maxiter`)**: The maximum number of iterations (`100`) limits the solver's attempts to converge. If the problem is complex, increasing this value might allow the solver to find a better solution, but it will also increase the runtime.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Method (`method`)**: Consider using the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method, which is often more robust and faster for non-linear optimization problems. BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix, potentially leading to faster convergence.

2. **Jacobian Approximation (`jac`)**: If the problem allows, consider using a more efficient Jacobian approximation method, such as '3-point' or even an analytical Jacobian if available. The '3-point' method can provide a more accurate approximation than '2-point', potentially improving convergence.

3. **Tolerance (`tol`)**: Increase the tolerance slightly to `0.001` to reduce the computational burden. This adjustment should still provide reasonably accurate results while significantly reducing runtime.

4. **Display Information (`disp`)**: Keep `disp` set to 'False' to minimize I/O overhead.

5. **Maximum Iterations (`maxiter`)**: Increase the maximum number of iterations to `200` to give the solver more flexibility to converge, especially with the BFGS method, which might require more iterations to achieve the desired accuracy.

### Optimized Parameters

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 200
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Method (`method`)**: Switching to the BFGS method can improve the convergence rate and robustness, especially for non-linear problems. BFGS is generally more efficient than CG for such problems.

2. **Jacobian Approximation (`jac`)**: Using the '3-point' method provides a more accurate Jacobian approximation, which can lead to faster convergence and better stability.

3. **Tolerance (`tol`)**: Increasing the tolerance to `0.001` reduces the computational burden while still maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. This change can significantly reduce runtime without compromising the quality of the solution too much.

4. **Display Information (`disp`)**: Keeping `disp` set to 'False' minimizes I/O operations, which can slightly improve performance.

5. **Maximum Iterations (`maxiter`)**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations to `200` allows the solver more opportunities to converge, which is particularly important when using the BFGS method.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
