To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the most critical parameters that affect performance. Here’s a revised configuration based on the provided documentation:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **method**:
   - **Current Value**: `CG`
   - **Suggested Value**: `BFGS`
   - **Rationale**: The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method is generally more efficient and robust compared to Conjugate Gradient (CG). It uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to improve convergence, which can lead to faster solutions, especially for problems where the gradient is expensive to compute.

2. **jac**:
   - **Current Value**: `2-point`
   - **Suggested Value**: `3-point`
   - **Rationale**: The 3-point finite difference method provides a more accurate estimate of the Jacobian compared to the 2-point method. This can lead to better convergence properties and potentially fewer iterations, thus reducing overall runtime.

3. **tol**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0001`
   - **Suggested Value**: `0.001`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the tolerance slightly can reduce the number of iterations required to achieve convergence. However, this should be balanced against the need for precision. A value of `0.001` is a reasonable compromise, providing a good balance between speed and accuracy.

4. **disp**:
   - **Current Value**: `False`
   - **Suggested Value**: `False`
   - **Rationale**: Keeping `disp` as `False` is appropriate if you do not need to see convergence messages during the optimization process. This reduces overhead and keeps the output clean.

5. **maxiter**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Suggested Value**: `500`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations to `500` allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge, especially with the more accurate Jacobian estimation and the more efficient BFGS method. However, monitor the actual number of iterations to ensure it does not become a bottleneck.

### Final Configuration:
```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Summary:
- **Method**: Switched from `CG` to `BFGS` for better efficiency and robustness.
- **Jacobian Estimation**: Changed from `2-point` to `3-point` for more accurate gradient estimation.
- **Tolerance**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations.
- **Maximum Iterations**: Increased from `100` to `500` to allow for more flexible convergence.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of your optimization process while maintaining the necessary level of accuracy and functionality.
