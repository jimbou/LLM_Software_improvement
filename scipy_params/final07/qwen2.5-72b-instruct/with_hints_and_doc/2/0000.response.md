To optimize the given configuration while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on runtime performance. These parameters include the choice of optimization method (`method`), the method for computing the Jacobian (`jac`), the tolerance for termination (`tol`), and the maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`).

### Optimized Configuration:

1. **method**:
   - **Current Value**: `CG`
   - **Optimized Value**: `L-BFGS-B`
   - **Rationale**: The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method is generally effective but can be slow to converge, especially for large-scale problems. The Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (`L-BFGS-B`) method is often faster and more robust, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex functions. It also supports bounds on variables, which can be useful if such constraints are relevant to your problem.

2. **jac**:
   - **Current Value**: `2-point`
   - **Optimized Value**: `3-point`
   - **Rationale**: The `3-point` method for computing the Jacobian is more accurate than the `2-point` method, which can lead to better convergence and potentially fewer iterations. However, it is slightly more computationally expensive per iteration. If computational cost per iteration is a concern, you might consider keeping `2-point` but increasing the tolerance (`tol`) slightly to balance accuracy and speed.

3. **tol**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0001`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.001`
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` can significantly decrease the number of iterations required to reach a solution, thereby reducing runtime. This trade-off is acceptable if the slight loss in precision does not critically affect the application's requirements.

4. **disp**:
   - **Current Value**: `False`
   - **Optimized Value**: `False`
   - **Rationale**: Keeping `disp` as `False` is appropriate unless you need detailed output during the optimization process. Displaying convergence messages can add overhead and is generally unnecessary for production environments.

5. **maxiter**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `500`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `500` provides more flexibility for the optimizer to converge, especially with the more robust `L-BFGS-B` method. This change ensures that the optimization process has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely terminating.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```python
method := 'L-BFGS-B'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Summary:
- **Method**: Switched from `CG` to `L-BFGS-B` for potentially faster and more robust convergence.
- **Jacobian**: Changed from `2-point` to `3-point` for better accuracy, which can lead to fewer iterations overall.
- **Tolerance**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations needed to achieve convergence.
- **Display**: Kept as `False` to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased from `100` to `500` to allow the optimizer more flexibility to converge.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance while maintaining the desired level of functionality.
