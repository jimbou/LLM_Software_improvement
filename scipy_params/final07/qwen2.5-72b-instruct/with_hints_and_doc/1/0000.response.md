To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the system's functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These include the choice of optimization method (`method`), the method for computing the Jacobian (`jac`), and the maximum number of iterations (`maxiter`). The tolerance (`tol`) and display settings (`disp`) also play roles, but they are generally less critical to runtime performance.

### Optimized Configuration:

1. **method**:
   - **Current Value**: `CG`
   - **Optimized Value**: `BFGS`
   - **Rationale**: The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is generally more efficient and robust compared to the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. BFGS is known for its faster convergence and ability to handle a wider range of problems, which can lead to reduced runtime.

2. **jac**:
   - **Current Value**: `2-point`
   - **Optimized Value**: `3-point`
   - **Rationale**: The `3-point` method for computing the Jacobian provides a more accurate gradient approximation compared to the `2-point` method. While it involves slightly more function evaluations, the improved accuracy can lead to faster convergence and fewer overall iterations, potentially reducing the total runtime.

3. **tol**:
   - **Current Value**: `0.0001`
   - **Optimized Value**: `0.001`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the tolerance value can reduce the number of iterations required to achieve convergence. However, this should be balanced against the need for precision. A tolerance of `0.001` is a reasonable compromise that often reduces runtime without significantly compromising the quality of the solution.

4. **disp**:
   - **Current Value**: `False`
   - **Optimized Value**: `False`
   - **Rationale**: Keeping `disp` set to `False` is appropriate as it avoids unnecessary output, which can slow down the process, especially in high-performance computing environments.

5. **maxiter**:
   - **Current Value**: `100`
   - **Optimized Value**: `500`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations to `500` allows the optimization process more flexibility to converge, especially with the more efficient BFGS method. This change ensures that the optimization has enough iterations to find a good solution without prematurely terminating.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```python
method := 'BFGS'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Summary:
- **Method**: Switched from `CG` to `BFGS` for potentially faster and more robust convergence.
- **Jacobian**: Changed from `2-point` to `3-point` for better gradient accuracy, which can lead to fewer iterations.
- **Tolerance**: Increased from `0.0001` to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.
- **Maximum Iterations**: Increased from `100` to `500` to allow the optimization process more flexibility to find a good solution.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of the optimization process while maintaining the desired level of functionality and solution quality.
