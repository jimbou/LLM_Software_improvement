To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the most critical parameters that affect performance. These are typically the optimization method, the method of computing the Jacobian, the tolerance for termination, and the maximum number of iterations.

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **method**: `L-BFGS-B`
   - **Rationale**: The `L-BFGS-B` method is generally faster and more robust than `CG` for many problems. It uses an approximation to the Hessian matrix, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance, especially for large-scale problems.

2. **jac**: `True`
   - **Rationale**: Setting `jac` to `True` indicates that the function provides the gradient, which can significantly speed up the optimization process compared to finite difference approximations like `2-point`. If the gradient is computationally expensive to calculate, consider using `3-point` or `cs` (Complex Step) for more accurate approximations.

3. **tol**: `0.001`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the tolerance from `0.0001` to `0.001` can reduce the number of iterations required to reach a solution, thus reducing runtime. However, this trade-off should be considered carefully as it might result in a less precise solution.

4. **disp**: `False`
   - **Rationale**: Keeping `disp` as `False` is appropriate unless you need detailed output during the optimization process. Displaying messages can slow down the process, so it's best to keep this off unless necessary for debugging.

5. **maxiter**: `500`
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the maximum number of iterations from `100` to `500` allows the optimizer more flexibility to converge to a solution, especially with the increased tolerance. This can help avoid premature termination due to the iteration limit.

### Final Configuration:

```python
method := 'L-BFGS-B'
jac := True
tol := 0.001
disp := False
maxiter := 500
```

### Explanation:

- **Method Change**: Switching from `CG` to `L-BFGS-B` leverages a more efficient and robust optimization algorithm, which can handle a wider range of problems and converge faster.
- **Jacobian Calculation**: Using `True` for `jac` ensures that the gradient is provided directly, which is typically faster and more accurate than finite difference approximations.
- **Tolerance Adjustment**: A slightly higher tolerance (`0.001`) reduces the computational burden while still providing a reasonable solution.
- **Maximum Iterations**: Increasing `maxiter` to `500` gives the optimizer more room to find a good solution without prematurely stopping.

These changes should collectively improve the runtime performance of your optimization process while maintaining the desired level of accuracy and functionality.
