To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. These include the optimization method, the method of computing the Jacobian, the tolerance for termination, and the maximum number of iterations.

### Optimized Configuration:

1. **method**: Change from `'CG'` to `'L-BFGS-B'`
   - **Rationale**: The Conjugate Gradient (`CG`) method is generally good but can be slow for large-scale problems. The Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (`L-BFGS-B`) method is often faster and more efficient, especially for problems with a large number of variables. It also supports bounds on variables, which might be useful if you need to constrain your solution space.

2. **jac**: Change from `'2-point'` to `'3-point'`
   - **Rationale**: The `3-point` method for computing the Jacobian is more accurate than the `2-point` method, which can lead to fewer iterations and thus faster convergence. However, it is slightly more computationally expensive per iteration, so this trade-off should be considered based on the specific problem.

3. **tol**: Increase from `0.0001` to `0.001`
   - **Rationale**: A higher tolerance value means that the optimization process will terminate earlier, potentially reducing the runtime. This is a trade-off between precision and speed. If the current tolerance of `0.0001` is too strict and not necessary for the application, increasing it to `0.001` can significantly speed up the process.

4. **disp**: Keep as `False`
   - **Rationale**: Setting `disp` to `False` ensures that no convergence messages are displayed, which can slightly improve performance by reducing I/O operations. This is particularly beneficial in high-performance computing environments.

5. **maxiter**: Increase from `100` to `500`
   - **Rationale**: While increasing the maximum number of iterations might seem counterintuitive to improving performance, it can prevent premature termination of the optimization process. By allowing more iterations, the optimizer has a better chance to converge to a more optimal solution, which can sometimes result in fewer overall iterations due to better convergence behavior.

### Final Optimized Configuration:
```python
method := 'L-BFGS-B'
jac := '3-point'
tol := 0.001
disp := 'False'
maxiter := 500
```

### Summary:
- **Method**: Switched to `L-BFGS-B` for potentially faster and more efficient optimization.
- **Jacobian**: Changed to `3-point` for better accuracy, which can lead to fewer iterations.
- **Tolerance**: Increased to `0.001` to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.
- **Display**: Kept `False` to minimize I/O overhead.
- **Max Iterations**: Increased to `500` to allow for better convergence without premature termination.

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of your optimization process while maintaining the desired level of functionality.
