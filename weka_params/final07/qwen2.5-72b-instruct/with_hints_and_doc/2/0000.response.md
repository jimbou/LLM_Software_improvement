To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on computational time. Here are the suggested optimizations:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **P** (Population Size / Number of Folds):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is a reasonable compromise between performance and model quality.

2. **I** (Number of Iterations / Epochs):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations can reduce training time without drastically affecting the model's performance, especially if the dataset is not extremely complex.

3. **K** (Number of Clusters / Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 10
   - **Rationale**: Setting a specific value for K can prevent the algorithm from spending time on automatic determination, which can be computationally expensive. A value of 10 is a common choice that balances performance and accuracy.

4. **M** (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf):
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf can help prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of the decision tree, leading to faster training and inference times.

5. **V** (Variance Threshold):
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the variance threshold can reduce the number of splits in the decision tree, simplifying the model and improving runtime performance.

6. **N** (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Using a small number of folds (e.g., 5) for cross-validation can provide a good balance between validation accuracy and computational efficiency.

7. **U** (Use Unpruned Tree):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` helps prevent overfitting, which can lead to better generalization and potentially faster performance.

8. **B** (Use Binary Splits Only):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Rationale**: Forcing binary splits can simplify the decision tree and reduce the number of levels, which can improve both training and inference times.

9. **num-decimal-places** (Number of Decimal Places):
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: This parameter has minimal impact on runtime performance, so it can remain unchanged unless higher precision is required for specific applications.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 10
M := 5
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the overall functionality and performance of the system.
