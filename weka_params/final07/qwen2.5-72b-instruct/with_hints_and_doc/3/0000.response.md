To optimize the configuration for reduced runtime while maintaining functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s a suggested optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **P**: 50
- **I**: 50
- **K**: 0
- **M**: 3
- **V**: 0.01
- **N**: 5
- **U**: 'False'
- **B**: 'False'
- **num-decimal-places**: 2

### Rationale:
1. **P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is still substantial enough to maintain good model quality while reducing the computational load.

2. **I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations reduces the training time. For many applications, 50 iterations are sufficient to achieve a good model fit without excessive computation.

3. **K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which is often a good balance between performance and accuracy.

4. **M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**:
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 3
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf helps prevent overfitting and simplifies the tree, which can reduce the time required for tree construction and evaluation.

5. **V (Variance Threshold)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the variance threshold reduces the sensitivity to small variance differences, leading to fewer splits and a simpler tree. This can significantly speed up the training process.

6. **N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Using 5-fold cross-validation provides a good balance between validation robustness and computational efficiency. It ensures that the model is validated sufficiently without the overhead of a larger number of folds.

7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**:
   - **Current Value**: 'False'
   - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` prevents overfitting and maintains a balance between model complexity and performance.

8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**:
   - **Current Value**: 'False'
   - **Optimized Value**: 'False'
   - **Rationale**: Allowing non-binary splits can lead to more efficient and compact trees, which can be faster to train and evaluate.

9. **num-decimal-places**:
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact runtime, so it remains unchanged to maintain the desired precision in output.

By making these adjustments, you should see a reduction in runtime while still maintaining the functionality and performance of your system.
