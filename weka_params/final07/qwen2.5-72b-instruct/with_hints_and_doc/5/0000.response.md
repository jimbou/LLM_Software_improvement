To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on computation time. Here are the suggested optimizations:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **P** (Population Size / Number of Folds):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is still reasonable and should maintain a good balance between speed and model quality.

2. **I** (Number of Iterations / Epochs):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations can reduce the training time without drastically affecting the model's performance, especially if the dataset is not extremely complex.

3. **K** (Number of Clusters / Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which is generally efficient and avoids manual tuning.

4. **M** (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf):
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf to 2 can help prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of the decision tree, leading to faster computation.

5. **V** (Variance Threshold):
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the variance threshold to 0.01 reduces the sensitivity to small variances, leading to fewer splits and a simpler tree, which can be computed more quickly.

6. **N** (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Using 5 folds for cross-validation strikes a balance between thoroughness and computational efficiency. This is a common choice that provides a good trade-off.

7. **U** (Use Unpruned Tree):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the tree is pruned, which can improve generalization and reduce computation time.

8. **B** (Use Binary Splits Only):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` allows the algorithm to use multi-way splits, which can be more efficient and lead to a more compact tree structure.

9. **num-decimal-places** (Number of Decimal Places):
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact computation time, so it can remain at 2 to maintain a reasonable level of precision.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the overall functionality and performance of the system.
