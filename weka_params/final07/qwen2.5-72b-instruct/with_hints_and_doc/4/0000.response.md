To optimize the configuration for reduced runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are the suggested improvements:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **P** (Population Size / Number of Folds):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is a good balance between performance and model quality.

2. **I** (Number of Iterations / Epochs):
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations can reduce training time. For many datasets, 50 iterations may still provide a good model, especially if the learning rate is appropriately set.

3. **K** (Number of Clusters / Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which can be efficient and effective.

4. **M** (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf):
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf can prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of the tree, leading to faster training and prediction times.

5. **V** (Variance Threshold):
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the variance threshold can reduce the number of splits, simplifying the tree and speeding up the process. A value of 0.01 is a reasonable compromise.

6. **N** (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors):
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this at 0 avoids the overhead of cross-validation, which can be computationally expensive.

7. **U** (Use Unpruned Tree):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Keeping the tree pruned helps prevent overfitting and reduces the complexity of the model, leading to faster performance.

8. **B** (Use Binary Splits Only):
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Allowing non-binary splits can sometimes lead to more efficient trees, so it's best to keep this as False unless binary splits are specifically required.

9. **num-decimal-places** (Number of Decimal Places):
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact runtime, so it can remain at 2 to maintain precision in output.

### Summary of Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 0
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

These changes should help reduce the runtime of the system while maintaining its functionality and effectiveness.
