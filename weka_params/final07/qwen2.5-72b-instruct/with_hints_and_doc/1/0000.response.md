To optimize the configuration for reduced runtime while maintaining functionality, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Here are the key parameters and suggested values:

1. **P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or the number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is still reasonable for most datasets and should maintain good model quality.

2. **I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations can reduce training time without drastically affecting the model's performance, especially if the dataset is not very complex.

3. **K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Setting a specific value for K can help avoid the overhead of automatic determination, which can be computationally expensive. A value of 5 is a common choice for many datasets.

4. **M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**:
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf can prevent overfitting and simplify the tree, leading to faster training and evaluation.

5. **V (Variance Threshold)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: A higher variance threshold reduces the number of splits, which can speed up the training process. A value of 0.01 is a reasonable compromise between performance and model complexity.

6. **N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors)**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Using a small number of folds for cross-validation can reduce the computational burden. A value of 5 is a standard choice for cross-validation.

7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**:
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` helps prevent overfitting and maintains a balance between model complexity and performance.

8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**:
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Rationale**: Enforcing binary splits can simplify the tree structure, leading to faster training and evaluation. This is particularly useful if the dataset is large.

9. **num-decimal-places (Number of Decimal Places)**:
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Rationale**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact runtime, so it can remain at 2 for a reasonable level of precision.

### Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 5
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

These changes should help reduce the runtime while maintaining the functional integrity of the system.
