### Analysis of Parameters

To optimize the configuration, we need to focus on parameters that significantly influence runtime performance. These parameters include:

1. **P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**: Larger values can improve model quality but increase computation time.
2. **I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**: More iterations can lead to better training but also increase computation time.
3. **K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors)**: The choice of K can affect both the complexity and performance of the model.
4. **M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**: Higher values can prevent overfitting but may lead to simpler models.
5. **V (Variance Threshold)**: Lower values allow more splits, which can increase model complexity and computation time.
6. **N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors)**: Cross-validation can significantly increase computation time.
7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**: Unpruned trees can overfit the data, leading to longer training times.
8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**: Binary splits can simplify the tree structure but may require more levels, potentially increasing computation time.

### Suggested Adjustments

1. **Reduce P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**:
   - Current: `100`
   - Suggested: `50`
   - **Reason**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time while still maintaining a reasonable model quality.

2. **Reduce I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**:
   - Current: `100`
   - Suggested: `50`
   - **Reason**: Fewer iterations can reduce computation time without drastically affecting the model's performance, especially if the dataset is not very complex.

3. **Set K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors) to a Reasonable Value**:
   - Current: `0`
   - Suggested: `10`
   - **Reason**: Setting a specific value for K can help the algorithm converge faster and avoid the overhead of automatically determining the optimal K.

4. **Increase M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**:
   - Current: `1`
   - Suggested: `5`
   - **Reason**: A higher minimum number of instances per leaf can prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of the tree, leading to faster training times.

5. **Increase V (Variance Threshold)**:
   - Current: `0.001`
   - Suggested: `0.01`
   - **Reason**: A higher variance threshold can reduce the number of splits, simplifying the tree and decreasing computation time.

6. **Set N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors) to a Non-Zero Value**:
   - Current: `0`
   - Suggested: `5`
   - **Reason**: Using a small number of folds for cross-validation can help validate the model without significantly increasing computation time.

7. **Set U (Use Unpruned Tree) to False**:
   - Current: `False`
   - Suggested: `False` (No change)
   - **Reason**: Keeping the tree pruned helps prevent overfitting and reduces computation time.

8. **Set B (Use Binary Splits Only) to True**:
   - Current: `False`
   - Suggested: `True`
   - **Reason**: Using binary splits can simplify the tree structure, potentially reducing the number of levels and computation time.

9. **Keep num-decimal-places as Is**:
   - Current: `2`
   - Suggested: `2` (No change)
   - **Reason**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact runtime performance, so it can remain unchanged.

### Optimized Configuration

```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 10
M := 5
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reducing P and I**: These changes directly reduce the computational load by decreasing the number of evaluations and iterations, respectively.
- **Setting K to 10**: This provides a balanced approach to clustering or nearest neighbors, avoiding the overhead of automatic determination.
- **Increasing M and V**: These changes simplify the decision tree, reducing its complexity and thus decreasing training time.
- **Setting N to 5**: Using a small number of folds for cross-validation helps validate the model without a significant increase in computation time.
- **Using Binary Splits (B = True)**: This simplifies the tree structure, potentially reducing the number of levels and computation time.

By implementing these adjustments, the runtime performance should improve while maintaining a reasonable level of model quality.
