To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their descriptions and constraints. Here are the optimized settings:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

### Rationale for Each Change:

1. **P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**:
   - **Original**: 100
   - **Optimized**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is still substantial enough to maintain good model quality while improving performance.

2. **I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**:
   - **Original**: 100
   - **Optimized**: 50
   - **Rationale**: Halving the number of iterations reduces the training time. For many datasets, 50 iterations can still provide a well-trained model, especially if the dataset is not overly complex.

3. **K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors)**:
   - **Original**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 0
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which is often a good default unless specific knowledge about the data suggests otherwise.

4. **M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**:
   - **Original**: 1
   - **Optimized**: 2
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf from 1 to 2 helps prevent overfitting and simplifies the tree structure, which can improve performance without significantly impacting model quality.

5. **V (Variance Threshold)**:
   - **Original**: 0.001
   - **Optimized**: 0.01
   - **Rationale**: Increasing the variance threshold from 0.001 to 0.01 reduces the sensitivity to small variance differences, leading to fewer splits and a simpler tree. This can improve runtime performance.

6. **N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors)**:
   - **Original**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Rationale**: Setting the number of folds to 5 enables a reasonable level of cross-validation, which helps in validating the model's performance without the overhead of using the entire dataset or a very high number of folds.

7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**:
   - **Original**: 'False'
   - **Optimized**: 'False'
   - **Rationale**: Keeping this as `False` prevents overfitting and maintains a balanced tree structure, which is generally beneficial for both performance and accuracy.

8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**:
   - **Original**: 'False'
   - **Optimized**: 'False'
   - **Rationale**: Allowing non-binary splits can sometimes lead to more efficient and accurate trees, so keeping this as `False` is appropriate unless there is a specific reason to enforce binary splits.

9. **num-decimal-places (Number of Decimal Places)**:
   - **Original**: 2
   - **Optimized**: 2
   - **Rationale**: The number of decimal places is already set to a reasonable value of 2, which provides sufficient precision without unnecessary overhead.

By making these adjustments, we aim to strike a balance between computational efficiency and model performance.
