To optimize the parameters for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to balance the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model quality. Hereâ€™s a suggested optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **P** := 50
- **I** := 50
- **K** := 0
- **M** := 2
- **V** := 0.01
- **N** := 5
- **U** := 'False'
- **B** := 'False'
- **num-decimal-places** := 2

### Rationale:
1. **P** (Population Size / Number of Folds):
   - Reduced from 100 to 50. This reduces the computational load while still providing a reasonable population size or number of folds for most tasks.

2. **I** (Number of Iterations / Epochs):
   - Reduced from 100 to 50. Fewer iterations can significantly reduce training time, especially for large datasets, while still allowing the model to learn effectively.

3. **K** (Number of Clusters / Neighbors):
   - Kept at 0. This allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which is often more efficient and accurate than manual tuning.

4. **M** (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf):
   - Increased from 1 to 2. This helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that each leaf has a minimum number of instances, leading to a more generalized model.

5. **V** (Variance Threshold):
   - Increased from 0.001 to 0.01. A higher variance threshold reduces the sensitivity to small variations in the data, which can help in creating a simpler and faster decision tree.

6. **N** (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors):
   - Set to 5. Using 5-fold cross-validation provides a good balance between validation accuracy and computational efficiency.

7. **U** (Use Unpruned Tree):
   - Kept as 'False'. Pruning helps prevent overfitting and generally leads to better generalization.

8. **B** (Use Binary Splits Only):
   - Kept as 'False'. Allowing non-binary splits can lead to more complex but potentially more accurate trees.

9. **num-decimal-places**:
   - Kept at 2. This provides a reasonable level of precision for most applications without adding unnecessary computational overhead.

These adjustments should help improve the runtime performance of your model while maintaining its functionality and accuracy.
