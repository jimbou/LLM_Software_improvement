To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully balance the parameters to reduce computational overhead without significantly compromising the quality of the model. Hereâ€™s a suggested optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **P (Population Size / Number of Folds)**:
   - **Original**: 100
   - **Optimized**: 50
   - **Reason**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time. A value of 50 is still reasonable and should maintain a good balance between speed and model quality.

2. **I (Number of Iterations / Epochs)**:
   - **Original**: 100
   - **Optimized**: 50
   - **Reason**: Halving the number of iterations can reduce training time. For many applications, 50 iterations are sufficient to achieve good performance, especially if the dataset is not extremely complex.

3. **K (Number of Clusters / Neighbors)**:
   - **Original**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 0
   - **Reason**: Keeping it at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which is often a good approach unless you have specific domain knowledge.

4. **M (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf)**:
   - **Original**: 1
   - **Optimized**: 2
   - **Reason**: Increasing this value slightly helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that leaves have a minimum number of instances. This can also reduce the depth of the tree, leading to faster training and prediction times.

5. **V (Variance Threshold)**:
   - **Original**: 0.001
   - **Optimized**: 0.01
   - **Reason**: Increasing the variance threshold reduces the sensitivity to small variance differences, which can lead to fewer splits and a simpler tree. This simplification can improve runtime performance.

6. **N (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors)**:
   - **Original**: 0
   - **Optimized**: 5
   - **Reason**: Using 5-fold cross-validation is a common practice that provides a good balance between validation robustness and computational efficiency. It ensures that the model is validated adequately without excessive computation.

7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**:
   - **Original**: 'False'
   - **Optimized**: 'False'
   - **Reason**: Keeping this as `False` helps prevent overfitting, which is generally beneficial for model generalization and performance.

8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**:
   - **Original**: 'False'
   - **Optimized**: 'False'
   - **Reason**: Allowing non-binary splits can sometimes lead to more efficient and accurate models. However, if binary splits are necessary for your specific application, you can consider setting this to `True`.

9. **num-decimal-places**:
   - **Original**: 2
   - **Optimized**: 2
   - **Reason**: The number of decimal places does not significantly impact runtime performance, so it remains unchanged. This value is appropriate for most applications and provides a reasonable level of precision.

By making these adjustments, you should see a reduction in runtime while maintaining the overall functionality and quality of the model.
