To optimize the configuration for improved runtime performance while maintaining functionality, we need to carefully adjust the parameters based on their impact on computation time and model quality. Here's a suggested optimized configuration:

### Optimized Parameters:

1. **P**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Reason**: Reducing the population size or number of folds can significantly decrease computation time, especially for large datasets. A value of 50 is a reasonable compromise that still allows for good model quality.

2. **I**:
   - **Current Value**: 100
   - **Optimized Value**: 50
   - **Reason**: Reducing the number of iterations can speed up the training process. For many datasets, 50 iterations are often sufficient to achieve good performance.

3. **K**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 0
   - **Reason**: Keeping this at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors, which can be efficient and effective.

4. **M**:
   - **Current Value**: 1
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Reason**: Increasing the minimum number of instances per leaf slightly can help prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of the tree, leading to faster computation.

5. **V**:
   - **Current Value**: 0.001
   - **Optimized Value**: 0.01
   - **Reason**: Increasing the variance threshold can reduce the number of splits, making the tree simpler and faster to compute. A value of 0.01 is a good balance between sensitivity and performance.

6. **N**:
   - **Current Value**: 0
   - **Optimized Value**: 5
   - **Reason**: Using a small number of folds for cross-validation (e.g., 5) can provide a good estimate of model performance while reducing computation time compared to using the entire dataset.

7. **U**:
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: False
   - **Reason**: Keeping the tree pruned helps prevent overfitting and reduces computation time.

8. **B**:
   - **Current Value**: False
   - **Optimized Value**: True
   - **Reason**: Using binary splits only can simplify the tree structure, potentially reducing the number of levels and speeding up computation.

9. **num-decimal-places**:
   - **Current Value**: 2
   - **Optimized Value**: 2
   - **Reason**: The current value of 2 is appropriate for most applications, providing a good balance between precision and readability.

### Final Optimized Configuration:

```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 2
V := 0.01
N := 5
U := False
B := True
num-decimal-places := 2
```

These adjustments should help improve runtime performance while maintaining the necessary functionality and model quality.
