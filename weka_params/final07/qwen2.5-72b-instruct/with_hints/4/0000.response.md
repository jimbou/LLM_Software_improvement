To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand the role and impact of each parameter. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis and optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **P (Proportional Gain):**
   - **Impact:** Controls the immediate response to the error.
   - **Optimization:** A higher value can make the system more responsive but can also lead to instability. A balanced value is crucial.
   - **Suggested Value:** Reduce slightly to 80 to balance responsiveness and stability.

2. **I (Integral Gain):**
   - **Impact:** Affects the accumulation of past errors, helping to eliminate steady-state error.
   - **Optimization:** A lower value can reduce overshoot and improve stability.
   - **Suggested Value:** Reduce to 50 to improve stability without significantly affecting steady-state error correction.

3. **K (Derivative Gain):**
   - **Impact:** Helps in predicting future errors based on the rate of change of the error.
   - **Optimization:** Setting this to a small non-zero value can help in damping oscillations.
   - **Suggested Value:** Set to 0.1 to provide some damping effect.

4. **M (Multiplier):**
   - **Impact:** Scales the output of the control loop.
   - **Optimization:** Keep as is since it is already set to a minimal value.
   - **Suggested Value:** Maintain at 1.

5. **V (Velocity):**
   - **Impact:** Controls the speed of the system's response.
   - **Optimization:** Increasing this slightly can speed up the system without causing instability.
   - **Suggested Value:** Increase to 0.005 to improve response time.

6. **N (Noise Filter):**
   - **Impact:** Filters out noise from the input signal.
   - **Optimization:** Setting this to a small non-zero value can help in reducing noise.
   - **Suggested Value:** Set to 0.1 to filter out minor noise.

7. **U (Use Advanced Features):**
   - **Impact:** Enables or disables advanced features that might add overhead.
   - **Optimization:** Disable if not necessary to reduce computational load.
   - **Suggested Value:** Keep as 'False'.

8. **B (Bias):**
   - **Impact:** Adds a constant offset to the output.
   - **Optimization:** Keep as is unless there is a specific need to adjust the baseline output.
   - **Suggested Value:** Maintain at 'False'.

9. **num-decimal-places:**
   - **Impact:** Determines the precision of the output.
   - **Optimization:** Reducing this can speed up computations but might affect precision.
   - **Suggested Value:** Reduce to 1 to balance precision and performance.

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
P := 80
I := 50
K := 0.1
M := 1
V := 0.005
N := 0.1
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Summary:
- **P** and **I** have been reduced to improve stability.
- **K** has been set to a small non-zero value to provide damping.
- **V** has been increased to improve response time.
- **N** has been set to a small non-zero value to filter noise.
- **num-decimal-places** has been reduced to 1 to speed up computations.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the system's functionality.
