To optimize the parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on performance. Hereâ€™s an analysis and suggested optimization:

### Analysis of Parameters:
1. **P (Proportional Gain)**: This parameter is crucial in control systems for determining how aggressively the system responds to errors. A higher value can make the system more responsive but also more prone to instability. Reducing this value might help in reducing the computational load if the system is stable enough with a lower gain.

2. **I (Integral Gain)**: This parameter helps in eliminating steady-state error over time. However, a high integral gain can cause the system to become sluggish or even unstable. Reducing this value can help in improving performance without significantly affecting stability.

3. **K (Derivative Gain)**: This parameter is often set to zero in many applications because it can introduce noise and make the system less stable. Keeping it at zero is generally a good choice unless specific derivative action is required.

4. **M (Multiplier)**: This parameter scales the output of the system. A value of 1 is typically neutral, so changing this might not have a significant impact unless there are specific reasons to scale the output differently.

5. **V (Velocity)**: This parameter controls the rate of change in the system. A very small value can slow down the system's response, which might be necessary for stability but can increase runtime. Increasing this value slightly can improve performance without compromising stability.

6. **N (Noise Filter)**: This parameter is often used to filter out noise from the system. Setting it to zero means no filtering is applied. If noise is not a significant issue, keeping it at zero is fine.

7. **U (Use Advanced Features)**: This parameter is a boolean flag that enables or disables advanced features. Disabling advanced features can reduce computational overhead.

8. **B (Batch Processing)**: This parameter is another boolean flag that enables or disables batch processing. Batch processing can sometimes improve performance by reducing the number of operations per unit time.

9. **num-decimal-places**: This parameter controls the precision of the output. Reducing the number of decimal places can reduce the computational load, especially if high precision is not critical.

### Optimized Parameters:
Based on the above analysis, here are the optimized parameter values:

```plaintext
P := 80
I := 80
K := 0
M := 1
V := 0.002
N := 0
U := 'False'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Explanation:
- **P := 80**: Reduced from 100 to 80 to potentially reduce the computational load while maintaining stability.
- **I := 80**: Reduced from 100 to 80 to improve performance without significantly affecting the system's ability to eliminate steady-state error.
- **K := 0**: Kept at 0 as it is often not necessary and can introduce noise.
- **M := 1**: Kept at 1 as it is neutral and does not affect performance.
- **V := 0.002**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.002 to speed up the system's response without causing instability.
- **N := 0**: Kept at 0 as noise filtering is not necessary.
- **U := 'False'**: Kept at 'False' to disable advanced features and reduce computational overhead.
- **B := 'True'**: Changed to 'True' to enable batch processing, which can improve performance by reducing the number of operations.
- **num-decimal-places := 1**: Reduced from 2 to 1 to decrease the computational load related to precision.

These changes should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the functionality of the system.
