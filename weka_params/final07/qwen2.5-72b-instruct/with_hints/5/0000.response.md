To optimize the given parameters for better runtime performance while maintaining the functionality of the system, we need to understand the role of each parameter in the context of the system. However, without specific details about the system's operation, I'll make general assumptions based on common control systems and numerical computations.

### Original Parameters:
- P := 100
- I := 100
- K := 0
- M := 1
- V := 0.001
- N := 0
- U := 'False'
- B := 'False'
- num-decimal-places := 2

### Analysis and Optimization:

1. **Proportional Gain (P):**
   - **Impact:** High proportional gain can lead to faster response but can also cause instability if too high.
   - **Optimization:** Reduce P to a more stable value. A good starting point might be P = 50.
   - **New Value:** P := 50

2. **Integral Gain (I):**
   - **Impact:** Integral gain helps eliminate steady-state error but can cause overshoot and oscillations if too high.
   - **Optimization:** Reduce I to a lower value to reduce potential overshoot and improve stability.
   - **New Value:** I := 50

3. **Derivative Gain (K):**
   - **Impact:** Derivative gain helps dampen the response and reduce overshoot, but it can introduce noise if set too high.
   - **Optimization:** Since K is currently 0, it might be beneficial to introduce a small value to help with damping.
   - **New Value:** K := 1

4. **Multiplier (M):**
   - **Impact:** This parameter scales the output. If M is 1, it has no effect on the output.
   - **Optimization:** Keep M as 1 unless there is a specific reason to change it.
   - **New Value:** M := 1

5. **Velocity (V):**
   - **Impact:** Velocity can affect how quickly the system responds. A very low value can slow down the system.
   - **Optimization:** Increase V slightly to speed up the response without causing instability.
   - **New Value:** V := 0.01

6. **Noise Threshold (N):**
   - **Impact:** This parameter can help filter out noise. If it's 0, no filtering is applied.
   - **Optimization:** Introduce a small noise threshold to filter out minor fluctuations.
   - **New Value:** N := 0.01

7. **Use Advanced Control (U):**
   - **Impact:** This boolean flag might enable advanced control algorithms which could be more computationally intensive.
   - **Optimization:** Set to 'False' to keep the system simple and fast.
   - **New Value:** U := 'False'

8. **Batch Processing (B):**
   - **Impact:** Batch processing can improve performance by processing multiple data points at once.
   - **Optimization:** Enable batch processing if it doesn't affect the real-time requirements of the system.
   - **New Value:** B := 'True'

9. **Number of Decimal Places (num-decimal-places):**
   - **Impact:** Reducing the number of decimal places can reduce computational overhead.
   - **Optimization:** Decrease the number of decimal places to 1 if the precision loss is acceptable.
   - **New Value:** num-decimal-places := 1

### Optimized Parameters:
- P := 50
- I := 50
- K := 1
- M := 1
- V := 0.01
- N := 0.01
- U := 'False'
- B := 'True'
- num-decimal-places := 1

These changes should help improve the runtime performance of the system while maintaining its functionality. Adjustments may still be needed based on the specific behavior and requirements of the system.
