To optimize the given parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to understand the context in which these parameters are used. However, without specific details about the algorithm or system these parameters control, I'll provide general guidelines and assumptions based on common practices in optimization.

### Parameters:
- **P (Proportional Gain):** 100
- **I (Integral Gain):** 100
- **K (Gain):** 0
- **M (Multiplier):** 1
- **V (Velocity or Step Size):** 0.001
- **N (Noise or Threshold):** 0
- **U (Use Flag):** 'False'
- **B (Boolean Flag):** 'False'
- **num-decimal-places:** 2

### Optimization Considerations:
1. **Proportional Gain (P):**
   - A high P can lead to faster response but may cause instability. Reducing P slightly might improve stability and reduce overshoot.
   - **Optimized Value:** 80

2. **Integral Gain (I):**
   - High I can eliminate steady-state error but can also cause oscillations. Reducing I can help stabilize the system.
   - **Optimized Value:** 50

3. **Gain (K):**
   - If K is set to 0, it might be disabled. If it's meant to be active, consider setting it to a small non-zero value.
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.1 (if it should be active)

4. **Multiplier (M):**
   - M = 1 is neutral. Adjusting M can scale the output, but it depends on the specific application.
   - **Optimized Value:** 1 (keep as is unless specific scaling is needed)

5. **Velocity or Step Size (V):**
   - A smaller V can lead to more precise but slower convergence. Increasing V can speed up the process but might reduce precision.
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.01

6. **Noise or Threshold (N):**
   - N = 0 means no noise or threshold filtering. Adding a small threshold can help filter out minor fluctuations.
   - **Optimized Value:** 0.01

7. **Use Flag (U):**
   - If U is 'False', it might disable certain features. If those features are not necessary, keep it as 'False'.
   - **Optimized Value:** 'False' (keep as is unless features are needed)

8. **Boolean Flag (B):**
   - Similar to U, if B is 'False', it might disable certain features. Keep it as 'False' unless those features are necessary.
   - **Optimized Value:** 'False' (keep as is unless features are needed)

9. **Number of Decimal Places:**
   - Reducing the number of decimal places can improve computational efficiency but might reduce precision.
   - **Optimized Value:** 1 (if precision loss is acceptable)

### Optimized Parameters:
```plaintext
P := 80
I := 50
K := 0.1
M := 1
V := 0.01
N := 0.01
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

These adjustments aim to balance between runtime efficiency and system stability. If you have more specific requirements or constraints, further tuning might be necessary.
