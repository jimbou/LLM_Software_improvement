To optimize the parameters for runtime efficiency, we need to understand the context and the specific application of these parameters. However, based on common practices in algorithm optimization, here are some general suggestions:

1. **Reduce Unnecessary Iterations**: If `P` and `I` are loop counters or similar, reducing their values can decrease runtime. However, this might affect the accuracy or completeness of the results. We need to find a balance.

2. **Eliminate Redundant Operations**: If `K`, `M`, `V`, `N`, `U`, and `B` are involved in operations that can be simplified or eliminated, doing so can improve performance.

3. **Optimize Data Types and Precision**: Reducing the number of decimal places can speed up floating-point operations, but it should not compromise the required precision.

4. **Boolean and String Optimization**: Boolean and string operations can be costly. If possible, convert them to more efficient forms.

Hereâ€™s an optimized version of the parameters:

### Optimized Parameters:
- **P**: 50 (reduced from 100 to potentially halve the number of iterations)
- **I**: 50 (reduced from 100 to potentially halve the number of iterations)
- **K**: 0 (unchanged, as it might be a necessary initial value)
- **M**: 1 (unchanged, as it might be a necessary scaling factor)
- **V**: 0.01 (reduced from 0.001 to reduce floating-point precision requirements)
- **N**: 0 (unchanged, as it might be a necessary initial value)
- **U**: False (converted from string 'False' to boolean False for efficiency)
- **B**: False (converted from string 'False' to boolean False for efficiency)
- **num-decimal-places**: 1 (reduced from 2 to further reduce floating-point precision requirements)

### Explanation:
- **P** and **I**: Reduced to 50 to decrease the number of iterations, which can significantly reduce runtime.
- **V**: Increased to 0.01 to reduce the precision of floating-point operations, which can be faster.
- **U** and **B**: Converted to boolean values to avoid the overhead of string comparisons.
- **num-decimal-places**: Reduced to 1 to further minimize the computational cost of floating-point operations.

These changes should help improve runtime performance while maintaining the essential functionality of your application. If you have specific constraints or requirements that these changes might violate, please provide more details so I can refine the optimization further.
