To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on computation and resource usage. Here's the analysis and suggested adjustments:

### Analysis:
1. **P (Proportional Gain)**: A higher value can speed up the response but might cause instability. Reducing it slightly can stabilize the system without significantly slowing it down.
2. **I (Integral Gain)**: A high value can cause overshooting and oscillations. Lowering it can help in achieving a more stable and controlled response.
3. **K (Derivative Gain)**: Currently set to 0, which means no derivative action is applied. Introducing a small derivative gain can help reduce overshoot and improve stability.
4. **M (Multiplier)**: A value of 1 is neutral. Adjusting this can scale the overall output, but it should be done carefully to avoid over-amplification.
5. **V (Step Size)**: A smaller step size increases accuracy but can slow down the simulation. Increasing it slightly can speed up the simulation while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
6. **N (Noise Level)**: Adding a small amount of noise can sometimes help in avoiding local minima in certain algorithms, but it can also introduce instability. Keeping it at 0 is generally safe.
7. **U (Use Adaptive Control)**: Enabling adaptive control can dynamically adjust the gains, which can improve performance in varying conditions.
8. **B (Boundary Constraints)**: Enabling boundary constraints can prevent the system from going into unstable states, which can improve reliability.
9. **num-decimal-places**: This affects the precision of the output. Reducing it can speed up computations, but it might affect the accuracy of the results.

### Suggested Adjustments:
1. **P**: Reduce slightly to 90 to ensure stability.
2. **I**: Reduce to 50 to prevent overshooting.
3. **K**: Set to 0.1 to introduce a small derivative gain for better stability.
4. **M**: Keep at 1 as it is currently neutral.
5. **V**: Increase to 0.01 to speed up the simulation.
6. **N**: Keep at 0 to maintain stability.
7. **U**: Set to 'True' to enable adaptive control.
8. **B**: Set to 'True' to enforce boundary constraints.
9. **num-decimal-places**: Reduce to 1 to speed up computations.

### Optimized Configuration:
```plaintext
P := 90
I := 50
K := 0.1
M := 1
V := 0.01
N := 0
U := 'True'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **P := 90**: Reducing the proportional gain slightly ensures the system remains stable while still responding quickly.
- **I := 50**: Lowering the integral gain helps in reducing overshooting and stabilizing the system.
- **K := 0.1**: Introducing a small derivative gain helps in damping oscillations and improving overall stability.
- **V := 0.01**: Increasing the step size speeds up the simulation while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy.
- **U := 'True'**: Enabling adaptive control allows the system to dynamically adjust its gains, which can improve performance under varying conditions.
- **B := 'True'**: Enforcing boundary constraints prevents the system from entering unstable states, enhancing reliability.
- **num-decimal-places := 1**: Reducing the number of decimal places speeds up computations, which can be beneficial for real-time systems.

These adjustments should help in achieving a more stable and efficient runtime performance.
