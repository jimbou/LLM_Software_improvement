To optimize the given configuration for better runtime performance, let's analyze each parameter and suggest adjustments:

1. **P (Proportional Gain)**: A high value can lead to faster response but might cause instability. Reducing it slightly can help stabilize the system without significantly affecting the response time.
2. **I (Integral Gain)**: A high value can reduce steady-state error but can also cause oscillations. Reducing it can help smooth out the response.
3. **K (Derivative Gain)**: Currently set to 0, which means no derivative action. Increasing it slightly can help dampen oscillations but should be done carefully.
4. **M (Multiplier)**: This parameter is already set to 1, which is a neutral value. No change needed here.
5. **V (Velocity)**: A very small value can slow down the system. Increasing it slightly can speed up the response without causing instability.
6. **N (Noise Reduction)**: Currently set to 0, which means no noise reduction. Adding a small value can help reduce high-frequency noise.
7. **U (Use Advanced Features)**: Setting this to 'True' can enable additional optimizations and features that might improve performance.
8. **B (Batch Processing)**: Enabling batch processing can help process multiple tasks more efficiently.
9. **num-decimal-places**: This affects the precision of the output. Reducing it can slightly improve performance if high precision is not critical.

Based on this analysis, here are the suggested adjustments:

```plaintext
P := 90
I := 50
K := 0.1
M := 1
V := 0.01
N := 1
U := 'True'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **P = 90**: Reduced from 100 to 90 to improve stability while maintaining a fast response.
- **I = 50**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to reduce the risk of oscillations.
- **K = 0.1**: Introduced a small derivative gain to help dampen any oscillations.
- **V = 0.01**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to speed up the system's response.
- **N = 1**: Added a small noise reduction factor to filter out high-frequency noise.
- **U = 'True'**: Enabled advanced features for potential performance improvements.
- **B = 'True'**: Enabled batch processing to handle multiple tasks more efficiently.
- **num-decimal-places = 1**: Reduced from 2 to 1 to slightly improve performance by reducing computational overhead.

These changes should help optimize the runtime performance of the system while maintaining stability and accuracy.
