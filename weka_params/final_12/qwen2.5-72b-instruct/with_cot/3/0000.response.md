To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, let's analyze each parameter:

1. **P (Proportional Gain):** This parameter affects how quickly the system responds to changes. A higher value can lead to faster response but may also cause instability. Given the context, reducing this value slightly might help in achieving a balance between responsiveness and stability.

2. **I (Integral Gain):** This parameter helps to eliminate steady-state error over time. However, a high value can cause oscillations. Reducing this value might help in stabilizing the system and improving performance.

3. **K (Derivative Gain):** This is currently set to 0, which means no derivative action. If the system is not showing signs of overshoot, this can remain as is. However, if there are issues with overshoot, a small positive value might help.

4. **M (Maximum Output):** This parameter limits the maximum output of the controller. Increasing this value might allow the system to respond more effectively, but it should be within safe operating limits.

5. **V (Sampling Time):** This parameter determines how frequently the system checks for changes. A smaller value means more frequent checks, which can improve responsiveness but also increase computational load. Increasing this value slightly might reduce the computational load without significantly affecting performance.

6. **N (Noise Band):** This parameter helps to filter out small, irrelevant changes in the input. Setting this to a non-zero value can help in reducing unnecessary adjustments and improving stability.

7. **U (Use Derivative on Measurement):** Setting this to 'True' can help in reducing overshoot by applying the derivative action directly to the measurement.

8. **B (Bias):** Setting this to 'True' can help in offsetting any constant errors in the system.

9. **num-decimal-places:** This parameter controls the precision of the output. Reducing this value can slightly reduce computational overhead.

Based on this analysis, here is the optimized configuration:

```plaintext
P := 80
I := 80
K := 0.1
M := 1.5
V := 0.002
N := 1
U := 'True'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **P and I:** Reduced from 100 to 80 to balance responsiveness and stability.
- **K:** Set to 0.1 to introduce a small amount of derivative action, which can help in reducing overshoot.
- **M:** Increased to 1.5 to allow for a higher maximum output, potentially improving system performance.
- **V:** Increased from 0.001 to 0.002 to reduce the computational load without significantly affecting responsiveness.
- **N:** Set to 1 to filter out small, irrelevant changes, improving stability.
- **U and B:** Both set to 'True' to apply derivative on measurement and add a bias, which can help in reducing overshoot and offsetting constant errors.
- **num-decimal-places:** Reduced from 2 to 1 to slightly reduce computational overhead.

These adjustments should help in improving the runtime performance while maintaining system stability and responsiveness.
