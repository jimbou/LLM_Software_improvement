### Explanation:
1. **P (Proportional Gain) Increased from 100 to 150**: Increasing the proportional gain can help the system respond more quickly to changes. However, too high a value can lead to instability, so it's balanced carefully.
2. **I (Integral Gain) Decreased from 100 to 50**: Reducing the integral gain can prevent the system from over-correcting and reduce steady-state error without causing oscillations.
3. **K (Derivative Gain) Set from 0 to 1**: Adding a derivative gain can help dampen the response and reduce overshoot, leading to a smoother control action.
4. **M (Multiplier) Increased from 1 to 2**: A higher multiplier can amplify the effect of the gains, potentially improving the response time but must be monitored to avoid instability.
5. **V (Step Size) Increased from 0.001 to 0.01**: A larger step size can speed up the convergence of the algorithm, but it should be small enough to maintain accuracy.
6. **N (Noise Filter) Set from 0 to 1**: Enabling a noise filter can help reduce the impact of noise on the system, leading to more stable and reliable performance.
7. **U (Use Advanced Features) Set from 'False' to 'True'**: Enabling advanced features can provide additional optimizations and functionalities that might improve performance.
8. **B (Bias Correction) Set from 'False' to 'True'**: Bias correction can help adjust for any systematic errors in the measurements, leading to more accurate results.
9. **num-decimal-places Increased from 2 to 3**: Increasing the number of decimal places can provide more precision in the output, which is useful for fine-tuning and accurate control.
