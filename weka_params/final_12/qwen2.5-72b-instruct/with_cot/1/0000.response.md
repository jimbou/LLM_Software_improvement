To optimize the configuration for better runtime performance, we need to focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on computational efficiency and resource utilization. Here's the analysis and optimization:

1. **P (Proportional Gain)**: A higher value can speed up the response but might cause instability. Reducing it slightly can stabilize the system without significantly impacting the response time.
2. **I (Integral Gain)**: This parameter is crucial for eliminating steady-state error but can cause oscillations if too high. Reducing it can help in stabilizing the system.
3. **K (Gain Factor)**: Setting this to zero might be suboptimal as it effectively disables certain aspects of the control loop. Adjusting it to a small positive value can help in fine-tuning the system.
4. **M (Multiplier)**: This parameter is generally kept low to avoid excessive amplification. Increasing it slightly can enhance the system's responsiveness.
5. **V (Velocity)**: A very small value can slow down the system. Increasing it can improve the responsiveness without causing instability.
6. **N (Noise Filter)**: Setting this to zero means no noise filtering, which can lead to erratic behavior. Enabling a basic level of noise filtering can improve stability.
7. **U (Use Advanced Features)**: Enabling advanced features can sometimes improve performance by utilizing more sophisticated algorithms.
8. **B (Batch Processing)**: Enabling batch processing can improve performance by processing multiple tasks at once.
9. **num-decimal-places**: Reducing the number of decimal places can decrease computational overhead, especially in real-time systems.

Based on this analysis, here are the optimized parameters:

```plaintext
P := 90
I := 50
K := 0.1
M := 1.2
V := 0.01
N := 1
U := 'True'
B := 'True'
num-decimal-places := 1
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **P**: Reduced from 100 to 90 to improve stability while maintaining a fast response.
- **I**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to reduce the risk of oscillations.
- **K**: Set to 0.1 to enable a small gain factor, improving fine-tuning.
- **M**: Increased from 1 to 1.2 to enhance system responsiveness.
- **V**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to improve system speed.
- **N**: Set to 1 to enable basic noise filtering, improving stability.
- **U**: Enabled (set to 'True') to utilize advanced features.
- **B**: Enabled (set to 'True') to leverage batch processing.
- **num-decimal-places**: Reduced from 2 to 1 to decrease computational overhead.

These changes should collectively improve the runtime performance of the system by enhancing stability, responsiveness, and computational efficiency.
