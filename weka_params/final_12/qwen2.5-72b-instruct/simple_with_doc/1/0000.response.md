### Explanation:
1. **P (Population Size)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to decrease computation time while still maintaining a reasonable population size for genetic algorithms or pruning.
2. **I (Iterations/Epochs)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to reduce training time, assuming the dataset and model complexity do not require extensive training.
3. **K (Clusters/Neighbors)**: Kept at 0 to allow the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors.
4. **M (Minimum Instances per Leaf)**: Increased from 1 to 2 to prevent overfitting by ensuring that each leaf node has at least 2 instances.
5. **V (Variance Threshold)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to make the decision tree less sensitive to small variances, which can help in reducing overfitting.
6. **N (Folds/Neighbors)**: Changed from 0 to 10 to enable cross-validation, which helps in assessing the model's generalization performance.
7. **U (Unpruned Tree)**: Kept as `False` to maintain the pruned tree, which helps in avoiding overfitting.
8. **B (Binary Splits Only)**: Kept as `False` to allow the decision tree to use non-binary splits, which can be more flexible and potentially more accurate.
9. **num-decimal-places**: Kept at 2, as it strikes a balance between precision and readability of the output.
