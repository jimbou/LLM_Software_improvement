### Explanation:
- **P (Population Size)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to decrease computation time while still maintaining a reasonable population size for evolutionary algorithms or number of folds for pruning.
- **I (Iterations)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to reduce the number of training epochs, which can significantly cut down on runtime without drastically affecting model quality.
- **K (Clusters/Neighbors)**: Kept at 0 to allow automatic determination based on the data.
- **M (Minimum Instances per Leaf)**: Increased from 1 to 3 to prevent overfitting by requiring a minimum number of instances per leaf.
- **V (Variance Threshold)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to make the decision tree less sensitive to small variances, potentially leading to simpler and faster trees.
- **N (Cross-Validation Folds)**: Set to 5 to enable cross-validation, which helps in better model evaluation and generalization.
- **U (Unpruned Tree)**: Kept as `False` to avoid overfitting.
- **B (Binary Splits Only)**: Kept as `False` to allow for more flexible tree structures.
- **num-decimal-places**: Kept at 2 as it provides a good balance between precision and readability.
