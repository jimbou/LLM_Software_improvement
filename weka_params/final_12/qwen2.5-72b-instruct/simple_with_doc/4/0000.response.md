### Explanation:
- **P (Population Size)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to decrease computation time, balancing speed and model quality.
- **I (Iterations/Epochs)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to reduce training time, especially useful if the model converges quickly.
- **K (Number of Clusters/Neighbors)**: Left as 0 to allow automatic determination, which is often efficient.
- **M (Minimum Instances Per Leaf)**: Increased from 1 to 2 to prevent overfitting and create simpler trees.
- **V (Variance Threshold)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to make the algorithm less sensitive to small variance differences, reducing complexity.
- **N (Number of Folds/Neighbors)**: Left as 0, assuming no cross-validation is needed or the default behavior is sufficient.
- **U (Unpruned Tree)**: Left as `False` to avoid overfitting.
- **B (Binary Splits Only)**: Left as `False` to maintain flexibility in tree structure.
- **num-decimal-places**: Left as 2, as this level of precision is usually sufficient for most applications.
