These adjustments aim to balance performance and accuracy:
- Reduced `P` from 100 to 50 to decrease the population size, which should reduce computation time without significantly affecting the model quality.
- Reduced `I` from 100 to 50 to decrease the number of iterations, which can help in reducing training time, especially if the model converges quickly.
- Increased `M` from 1 to 2 to slightly increase the minimum number of instances per leaf, helping to prevent overfitting and simplify the tree structure.
- Increased `V` from 0.001 to 0.005 to make the variance threshold less sensitive, which can help in reducing the complexity of the tree and potentially improving generalization.
- Other parameters remain unchanged as they are either already optimized or do not significantly impact performance.
