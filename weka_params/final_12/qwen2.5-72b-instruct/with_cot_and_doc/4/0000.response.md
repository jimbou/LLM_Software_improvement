### Explanation:

1. **P (Population Size)**
   - **Original**: 100
   - **New**: 50
   - **Impact**: Reducing the population size can decrease computation time, especially if the dataset is large. This balances the need for a diverse population with the computational cost.

2. **I (Iterations/Epochs)**
   - **Original**: 100
   - **New**: 50
   - **Impact**: Decreasing the number of iterations can significantly reduce training time. For many tasks, 50 iterations might still provide a good model while being more efficient.

3. **K (Number of Clusters/Neighbors)**
   - **Original**: 0
   - **New**: 0
   - **Impact**: Keeping K at 0 allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number, which is often a good default unless you have specific domain knowledge suggesting otherwise.

4. **M (Minimum Instances Per Leaf)**
   - **Original**: 1
   - **New**: 2
   - **Impact**: Increasing this value slightly can help prevent overfitting by ensuring that leaves are not too small. This can lead to more generalizable models.

5. **V (Variance Threshold)**
   - **Original**: 0.001
   - **New**: 0.005
   - **Impact**: Raising the variance threshold can reduce the number of splits, leading to simpler trees and faster computation. This is particularly useful if the data has high variance and you want to avoid overly complex models.

6. **N (Number of Folds/Neighbors)**
   - **Original**: 0
   - **New**: 5
   - **Impact**: Setting N to 5 enables cross-validation, which helps in assessing the model's performance more robustly. This is a balanced choice that provides a good trade-off between computational cost and validation accuracy.

7. **U (Use Unpruned Tree)**
   - **Original**: False
   - **New**: False
   - **Impact**: Keeping this as `False` ensures that the tree is pruned, which helps in reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

8. **B (Use Binary Splits Only)**
   - **Original**: False
   - **New**: False
   - **Impact**: Maintaining this as `False` allows the algorithm to use non-binary splits, which can be more expressive and capture complex patterns in the data.

9. **num-decimal-places**
   - **Original**: 2
   - **New**: 2
   - **Impact**: Keeping the number of decimal places at 2 ensures that the output remains readable and precise enough for most practical purposes without unnecessary computational overhead.

These adjustments aim to optimize the balance between model performance and computational efficiency.
