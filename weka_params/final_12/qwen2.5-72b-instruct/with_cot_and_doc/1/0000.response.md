### Explanation of Changes:
1. **P**: Retained at `100` as it balances population size or fold count well, which is generally beneficial for both accuracy and computational efficiency.

2. **I**: Reduced from `100` to `50`. Fewer iterations can significantly reduce computation time, especially if the initial 50 iterations are sufficient for convergence. This adjustment helps in reducing the overall runtime without compromising too much on the model's performance.

3. **K**: Kept at `0` since it allows the algorithm to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters or neighbors based on the data, which is usually a good default unless specific domain knowledge suggests otherwise.

4. **M**: Increased from `1` to `2`. A slightly higher value helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that each leaf node has a minimum number of instances, leading to a more generalized model.

5. **V**: Increased from `0.001` to `0.01`. A higher variance threshold reduces the sensitivity to small variations in the data, potentially leading to fewer, more significant splits, which can help in reducing overfitting and improving performance.

6. **N**: Set to `10` instead of `0`. Using 10-fold cross-validation can provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance, which is useful for model selection and validation without significantly increasing the runtime.

7. **U**: Kept at `'False'` to avoid overfitting. An unpruned tree can capture noise in the data, leading to poor generalization.

8. **B**: Set to `'True'` to force binary splits. Binary splits simplify the tree structure, making it easier to interpret and potentially faster to compute.

9. **num-decimal-places**: Kept at `2` as it provides a reasonable balance between precision and readability of the output.

These adjustments aim to optimize the runtime performance while maintaining a good balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency.
