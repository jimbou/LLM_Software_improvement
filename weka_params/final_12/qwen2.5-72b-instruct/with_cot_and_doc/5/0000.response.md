### Explanation of Changes:
1. **P** (Population Size / Number of Folds): Reduced from `100` to `50`. This can reduce computation time while still maintaining a reasonable balance between speed and accuracy.
2. **I** (Number of Iterations / Epochs): Reduced from `100` to `50`. Fewer iterations can significantly reduce training time, especially for large datasets, while still allowing the model to learn important patterns.
3. **K** (Number of Clusters / Neighbors): Kept at `0` to allow automatic determination, which is often optimal for many datasets.
4. **M** (Minimum Number of Instances per Leaf): Increased from `1` to `2`. This helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that leaves have a minimum number of instances, leading to simpler and more generalizable trees.
5. **V** (Variance Threshold): Increased from `0.001` to `0.005`. A slightly higher variance threshold can help the tree avoid splitting on very small variances, which can also reduce overfitting.
6. **N** (Number of Folds / Nearest Neighbors): Increased from `0` to `10`. Using cross-validation with 10 folds can provide a better estimate of model performance and help prevent overfitting.
7. **U** (Use Unpruned Tree): Kept as `False` to avoid overfitting, which is generally a good practice unless you have a specific reason to use an unpruned tree.
8. **B** (Use Binary Splits Only): Kept as `False` to allow the algorithm to use multi-way splits, which can be more efficient and expressive.
9. **num-decimal-places**: Kept at `2` as it provides a good balance between precision and readability.

These adjustments aim to optimize the runtime performance by reducing computational overhead while maintaining a reasonable level of model accuracy and generalization.
