### Explanation:
- **P (Proportional Gain):** Reduced from 100 to 50 to avoid excessive overshoot and instability.
- **I (Integral Gain):** Reduced from 100 to 50 to balance the response and prevent slow convergence.
- **K (Derivative Gain):** Increased from 0 to 1 to add a stabilizing effect and improve response time.
- **V (Step Size):** Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to speed up the convergence without causing instability.
- **Other Parameters:** Kept unchanged as they are less critical to performance or maintain essential functionality.
