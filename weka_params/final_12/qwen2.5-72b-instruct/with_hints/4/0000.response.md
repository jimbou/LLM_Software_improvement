### Explanation:
- **P (Proportional Gain)**: Reduced from 100 to 50. A lower value can help stabilize the system and prevent overshooting, which might improve runtime performance by reducing oscillations.
- **I (Integral Gain)**: Similarly reduced from 100 to 50. Lowering this value can also help stabilize the system and reduce the time it takes to reach a steady state.
- **V (Velocity)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01. A higher velocity can speed up the response time of the system, potentially reducing the overall runtime.

These changes aim to balance the system's responsiveness and stability, which should help in reducing the runtime while maintaining the desired functionality.
