### Explanation:
- **I (Integral Term)**: Reduced from 100 to 50. The integral term can significantly affect the stability and response time of the system. A lower value can help reduce overshoot and improve settling time.
- **V (Velocity)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01. A higher velocity can speed up the system's response without compromising stability, assuming the system can handle the increased rate of change.
- **Other Parameters**: Kept the same as they do not have a direct impact on runtime performance or their impact is minimal compared to the changes made to `I` and `V`.
