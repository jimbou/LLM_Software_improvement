```plaintext
P := 50
I := 50
K := 0
M := 1
V := 0.01
N := 0
U := 'False'
B := 'False'
num-decimal-places := 2
```

### Explanation:
- **P and I**: These parameters likely control the proportional and integral gains in a control system. Reducing them from 100 to 50 can help stabilize the system and potentially reduce oscillations, leading to better performance.
- **V**: This parameter might be a step size or learning rate. Increasing it from 0.001 to 0.01 can speed up convergence, but it should be monitored to ensure stability.
- **Other Parameters**: The remaining parameters (K, M, N, U, B, num-decimal-places) were not changed as they do not appear to directly impact performance as significantly. However, if further optimization is needed, these can be reviewed as well.
