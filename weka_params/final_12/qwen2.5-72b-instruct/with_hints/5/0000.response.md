### Explanation:
- **P (Proportional Gain):** Reduced from 100 to 50 to potentially stabilize the system and reduce overshoot, which can often lead to more efficient and stable performance.
- **I (Integral Gain):** Similarly reduced from 100 to 50 to balance the integral action, which helps in reducing steady-state error without causing excessive oscillation.
- **V (Velocity):** Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to speed up the response time, which can reduce the overall runtime while still maintaining control accuracy.

These changes aim to optimize the system's performance by balancing stability and response time.
