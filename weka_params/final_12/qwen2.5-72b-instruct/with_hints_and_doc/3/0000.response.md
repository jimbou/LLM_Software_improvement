### Explanation:
- **P (Population Size)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to decrease computation time while still maintaining a reasonable population size.
- **I (Iterations)**: Reduced from 100 to 50 to speed up training while ensuring enough iterations for convergence.
- **K (Number of Clusters/Neighbors)**: Kept at 0 to allow automatic determination, which is often efficient and adaptive.
- **M (Minimum Instances per Leaf)**: Increased from 1 to 2 to prevent overfitting and simplify the tree.
- **V (Variance Threshold)**: Increased from 0.001 to 0.01 to reduce sensitivity to small variances, leading to faster splits.
- **N (Number of Folds/Neighbors)**: Set to 10 for cross-validation, which provides a good balance between validation and computation time.
- **U (Unpruned Tree)**: Kept as `False` to avoid overfitting.
- **B (Binary Splits Only)**: Kept as `False` to allow for more flexible tree structures.
- **num-decimal-places**: Kept at 2 as it provides a good balance between precision and readability.
